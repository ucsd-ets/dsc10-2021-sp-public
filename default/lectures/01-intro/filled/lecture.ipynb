       " 'ONE\\n\\nPLAYING PILGRIMS\\n\\n\"Christmas won\\'t be Christmas without any presents,\" grumbled Jo, lying\\non the rug.\\n\\n\"It\\'s so dreadful to be poor!\" sighed Meg, looking down at her old\\ndress.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think it\\'s fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty\\nthings, and other girls nothing at all,\" added little Amy, with an\\ninjured sniff.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve got Father and Mother, and each other,\" said Beth contentedly\\nfrom her corner.\\n\\nThe four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the\\ncheerful words, but darkened again as Jo said sadly, \"We haven\\'t got\\nFather, and shall not have him for a long time.\" She didn\\'t say\\n\"perhaps never,\" but each silently added it, thinking of Father far\\naway, where the fighting was.\\n\\nNobody spoke for a minute; then Meg said in an altered tone, \"You know\\nthe reason Mother proposed not having any presents this Christmas was\\nbecause it is going to be a hard winter for everyone; and she thinks we\\nought not to spend money for pleasure, when our men are suffering so in\\nthe army.  We can\\'t do much, but we can make our little sacrifices, and\\nought to do it gladly.  But I am afraid I don\\'t,\" and Meg shook her\\nhead, as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted.\\n\\n\"But I don\\'t think the little we should spend would do any good.  We\\'ve\\neach got a dollar, and the army wouldn\\'t be much helped by our giving\\nthat.  I agree not to expect anything from Mother or you, but I do want\\nto buy _Undine and Sintran_ for myself.  I\\'ve wanted it so long,\" said\\nJo, who was a bookworm.\\n\\n\"I planned to spend mine in new music,\" said Beth, with a little sigh,\\nwhich no one heard but the hearth brush and kettle-holder.\\n\\n\"I shall get a nice box of Faber\\'s drawing pencils; I really need\\nthem,\" said Amy decidedly.\\n\\n\"Mother didn\\'t say anything about our money, and she won\\'t wish us to\\ngive up everything.  Let\\'s each buy what we want, and have a little\\nfun; I\\'m sure we work hard enough to earn it,\" cried Jo, examining the\\nheels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.\\n\\n\"I know I do--teaching those tiresome children nearly all day, when I\\'m\\nlonging to enjoy myself at home,\" began Meg, in the complaining tone\\nagain.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t have half such a hard time as I do,\" said Jo. \"How would you\\nlike to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps\\nyou trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you till you\\'re ready to\\nfly out the window or cry?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s naughty to fret, but I do think washing dishes and keeping things\\ntidy is the worst work in the world.  It makes me cross, and my hands\\nget so stiff, I can\\'t practice well at all.\" And Beth looked at her\\nrough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t believe any of you suffer as I do,\" cried Amy, \"for you don\\'t\\nhave to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you\\ndon\\'t know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and label your\\nfather if he isn\\'t rich, and insult you when your nose isn\\'t nice.\"\\n\\n\"If you mean libel, I\\'d say so, and not talk about labels, as if Papa\\nwas a pickle bottle,\" advised Jo, laughing.\\n\\n\"I know what I mean, and you needn\\'t be statirical about it. It\\'s\\nproper to use good words, and improve your vocabilary,\" returned Amy,\\nwith dignity.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t peck at one another, children.  Don\\'t you wish we had the money\\nPapa lost when we were little, Jo?  Dear me! How happy and good we\\'d\\nbe, if we had no worries!\" said Meg, who could remember better times.\\n\\n\"You said the other day you thought we were a deal happier than the\\nKing children, for they were fighting and fretting all the time, in\\nspite of their money.\"\\n\\n\"So I did, Beth.  Well, I think we are.  For though we do have to work,\\nwe make fun of ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as Jo would say.\"\\n\\n\"Jo does use such slang words!\" observed Amy, with a reproving look at\\nthe long figure stretched on the rug.\\n\\nJo immediately sat up, put her hands in her pockets, and began to\\nwhistle.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t, Jo.  It\\'s so boyish!\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s why I do it.\"\\n\\n\"I detest rude, unladylike girls!\"\\n\\n\"I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!\"\\n\\n\"Birds in their little nests agree,\" sang Beth, the peacemaker, with\\nsuch a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh, and the\\n\"pecking\" ended for that time.\\n\\n\"Really, girls, you are both to be blamed,\" said Meg, beginning to\\nlecture in her elder-sisterly fashion. \"You are old enough to leave off\\nboyish tricks, and to behave better, Josephine.  It didn\\'t matter so\\nmuch when you were a little girl, but now you are so tall, and turn up\\nyour hair, you should remember that you are a young lady.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not!   And if turning up my hair makes me one, I\\'ll wear it in two\\ntails till I\\'m twenty,\" cried Jo, pulling off her net, and shaking down\\na chestnut mane.  \"I hate to think I\\'ve got to grow up, and be Miss\\nMarch, and wear long gowns, and look as prim as a China Aster!  It\\'s\\nbad enough to be a girl, anyway, when I like boy\\'s games and work and\\nmanners!  I can\\'t get over my disappointment in not being a boy.  And\\nit\\'s worse than ever now, for I\\'m dying to go and fight with Papa. And\\nI can only stay home and knit, like a poky old woman!\"\\n\\nAnd Jo shook the blue army sock till the needles rattled like\\ncastanets, and her ball bounded across the room.\\n\\n\"Poor Jo!  It\\'s too bad, but it can\\'t be helped.  So you must try to be\\ncontented with making your name boyish, and playing brother to us\\ngirls,\" said Beth, stroking the rough head with a hand that all the\\ndish washing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in its\\ntouch.\\n\\n\"As for you, Amy,\" continued Meg, \"you are altogether too particular\\nand prim.  Your airs are funny now, but you\\'ll grow up an affected\\nlittle goose, if you don\\'t take care. I like your nice manners and\\nrefined ways of speaking, when you don\\'t try to be elegant.  But your\\nabsurd words are as bad as Jo\\'s slang.\"\\n\\n\"If Jo is a tomboy and Amy a goose, what am I, please?\" asked Beth,\\nready to share the lecture.\\n\\n\"You\\'re a dear, and nothing else,\" answered Meg warmly, and no one\\ncontradicted her, for the \\'Mouse\\' was the pet of the family.\\n\\nAs young readers like to know \\'how people look\\', we will take this\\nmoment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters, who sat\\nknitting away in the twilight, while the December snow fell quietly\\nwithout, and the fire crackled cheerfully within.  It was a comfortable\\nroom, though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain, for a\\ngood picture or two hung on the walls, books filled the recesses,\\nchrysanthemums and Christmas roses bloomed in the windows, and a\\npleasant atmosphere of home peace pervaded it.\\n\\nMargaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty, being\\nplump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft brown hair, a sweet\\nmouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain. Fifteen-year-old\\nJo was very tall, thin, and brown, and reminded one of a colt, for she\\nnever seemed to know what to do with her long limbs, which were very\\nmuch in her way.  She had a decided mouth, a comical nose, and sharp,\\ngray eyes, which appeared to see everything, and were by turns fierce,\\nfunny, or thoughtful.  Her long, thick hair was her one beauty, but it\\nwas usually bundled into a net, to be out of her way.  Round shoulders\\nhad Jo, big hands and feet, a flyaway look to her clothes, and the\\nuncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a\\nwoman and didn\\'t like it. Elizabeth, or Beth, as everyone called her,\\nwas a rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy\\nmanner, a timid voice, and a peaceful expression which was seldom\\ndisturbed.  Her father called her \\'Little Miss Tranquility\\', and the\\nname suited her excellently, for she seemed to live in a happy world of\\nher own, only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved.\\nAmy, though the youngest, was a most important person, in her own\\nopinion at least.  A regular snow maiden, with blue eyes, and yellow\\nhair curling on her shoulders, pale and slender, and always carrying\\nherself like a young lady mindful of her manners.  What the characters\\nof the four sisters were we will leave to be found out.\\n\\nThe clock struck six and, having swept up the hearth, Beth put a pair\\nof slippers down to warm.  Somehow the sight of the old shoes had a\\ngood effect upon the girls, for Mother was coming, and everyone\\nbrightened to welcome her.  Meg stopped lecturing, and lighted the\\nlamp, Amy got out of the easy chair without being asked, and Jo forgot\\nhow tired she was as she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the\\nblaze.\\n\\n\"They are quite worn out.  Marmee must have a new pair.\"\\n\\n\"I thought I\\'d get her some with my dollar,\" said Beth.\\n\\n\"No, I shall!\" cried Amy.\\n\\n\"I\\'m the oldest,\" began Meg, but Jo cut in with a decided, \"I\\'m the man\\nof the family now Papa is away, and I shall provide the slippers, for\\nhe told me to take special care of Mother while he was gone.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll tell you what we\\'ll do,\" said Beth, \"let\\'s each get her something\\nfor Christmas, and not get anything for ourselves.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s like you, dear!  What will we get?\" exclaimed Jo.\\n\\nEveryone thought soberly for a minute, then Meg announced, as if the\\nidea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands, \"I shall give\\nher a nice pair of gloves.\"\\n\\n\"Army shoes, best to be had,\" cried Jo.\\n\\n\"Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed,\" said Beth.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll get a little bottle of cologne.  She likes it, and it won\\'t cost\\nmuch, so I\\'ll have some left to buy my pencils,\" added Amy.\\n\\n\"How will we give the things?\" asked Meg.\\n\\n\"Put them on the table, and bring her in and see her open the bundles.\\nDon\\'t you remember how we used to do on our birthdays?\" answered Jo.\\n\\n\"I used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the chair\\nwith the crown on, and see you all come marching round to give the\\npresents, with a kiss.  I liked the things and the kisses, but it was\\ndreadful to have you sit looking at me while I opened the bundles,\"\\nsaid Beth, who was toasting her face and the bread for tea at the same\\ntime.\\n\\n\"Let Marmee think we are getting things for ourselves, and then\\nsurprise her.  We must go shopping tomorrow afternoon, Meg. There is so\\nmuch to do about the play for Christmas night,\" said Jo, marching up\\nand down, with her hands behind her back, and her nose in the air.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t mean to act any more after this time.  I\\'m getting too old for\\nsuch things,\" observed Meg, who was as much a child as ever about\\n\\'dressing-up\\' frolics.\\n\\n\"You won\\'t stop, I know, as long as you can trail round in a white gown\\nwith your hair down, and wear gold-paper jewelry. You are the best\\nactress we\\'ve got, and there\\'ll be an end of everything if you quit the\\nboards,\" said Jo.  \"We ought to rehearse tonight.  Come here, Amy, and\\ndo the fainting scene, for you are as stiff as a poker in that.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t help it.  I never saw anyone faint, and I don\\'t choose to make\\nmyself all black and blue, tumbling flat as you do.  If I can go down\\neasily, I\\'ll drop.  If I can\\'t, I shall fall into a chair and be\\ngraceful.  I don\\'t care if Hugo does come at me with a pistol,\"\\nreturned Amy, who was not gifted with dramatic power, but was chosen\\nbecause she was small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain\\nof the piece.\\n\\n\"Do it this way.  Clasp your hands so, and stagger across the room,\\ncrying frantically, \\'Roderigo! Save me! Save me!\\'\" and away went Jo,\\nwith a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling.\\n\\nAmy followed, but she poked her hands out stiffly before her, and\\njerked herself along as if she went by machinery, and her \"Ow!\" was\\nmore suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish.\\nJo gave a despairing groan, and Meg laughed outright, while Beth let\\nher bread burn as she watched the fun with interest. \"It\\'s no use!  Do\\nthe best you can when the time comes, and if the audience laughs, don\\'t\\nblame me.  Come on, Meg.\"\\n\\nThen things went smoothly, for Don Pedro defied the world in a speech\\nof two pages without a single break.  Hagar, the witch, chanted an\\nawful incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads, with weird\\neffect.  Roderigo rent his chains asunder manfully, and Hugo died in\\nagonies of remorse and arsenic, with a wild, \"Ha! Ha!\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s the best we\\'ve had yet,\" said Meg, as the dead villain sat up and\\nrubbed his elbows.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t see how you can write and act such splendid things, Jo.\\nYou\\'re a regular Shakespeare!\" exclaimed Beth, who firmly believed that\\nher sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things.\\n\\n\"Not quite,\" replied Jo modestly.  \"I do think _The Witches Curse, an\\nOperatic Tragedy_ is rather a nice thing, but I\\'d like to try\\n_Macbeth_, if we only had a trapdoor for Banquo.  I always wanted to do\\nthe killing part.  \\'Is that a dagger that I see before me?\" muttered\\nJo, rolling her eyes and clutching at the air, as she had seen a famous\\ntragedian do.\\n\\n\"No, it\\'s the toasting fork, with Mother\\'s shoe on it instead of the\\nbread.  Beth\\'s stage-struck!\" cried Meg, and the rehearsal ended in a\\ngeneral burst of laughter.\\n\\n\"Glad to find you so merry, my girls,\" said a cheery voice at the door,\\nand actors and audience turned to welcome a tall, motherly lady with a\\n\\'can I help you\\' look about her which was truly delightful. She was not\\nelegantly dressed, but a noble-looking woman, and the girls thought the\\ngray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in\\nthe world.\\n\\n\"Well, dearies, how have you got on today?  There was so much to do,\\ngetting the boxes ready to go tomorrow, that I didn\\'t come home to\\ndinner.  Has anyone called, Beth?  How is your cold, Meg?  Jo, you look\\ntired to death.  Come and kiss me, baby.\"\\n\\nWhile making these maternal inquiries Mrs. March got her wet things\\noff, her warm slippers on, and sitting down in the easy chair, drew Amy\\nto her lap, preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day.  The\\ngirls flew about, trying to make things comfortable, each in her own\\nway.  Meg arranged the tea table, Jo brought wood and set chairs,\\ndropping, over-turning, and clattering everything she touched.  Beth\\ntrotted to and fro between parlor kitchen, quiet and busy, while Amy\\ngave directions to everyone, as she sat with her hands folded.\\n\\nAs they gathered about the table, Mrs. March said, with a particularly\\nhappy face, \"I\\'ve got a treat for you after supper.\"\\n\\nA quick, bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine. Beth\\nclapped her hands, regardless of the biscuit she held, and Jo tossed up\\nher napkin, crying, \"A letter!  A letter!  Three cheers for Father!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, a nice long letter.  He is well, and thinks he shall get through\\nthe cold season better than we feared.  He sends all sorts of loving\\nwishes for Christmas, and an especial message to you girls,\" said Mrs.\\nMarch, patting her pocket as if she had got a treasure there.\\n\\n\"Hurry and get done!  Don\\'t stop to quirk your little finger and simper\\nover your plate, Amy,\" cried Jo, choking on her tea and dropping her\\nbread, butter side down, on the carpet in her haste to get at the treat.\\n\\nBeth ate no more, but crept away to sit in her shadowy corner and brood\\nover the delight to come, till the others were ready.\\n\\n\"I think it was so splendid in Father to go as chaplain when he was too\\nold to be drafted, and not strong enough for a soldier,\" said Meg\\nwarmly.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t I wish I could go as a drummer, a vivan--what\\'s its name?  Or a\\nnurse, so I could be near him and help him,\" exclaimed Jo, with a groan.\\n\\n\"It must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent, and eat all sorts of\\nbad-tasting things, and drink out of a tin mug,\" sighed Amy.\\n\\n\"When will he come home, Marmee?\" asked Beth, with a little quiver in\\nher voice.\\n\\n\"Not for many months, dear, unless he is sick.  He will stay and do his\\nwork faithfully as long as he can, and we won\\'t ask for him back a\\nminute sooner than he can be spared.  Now come and hear the letter.\"\\n\\nThey all drew to the fire, Mother in the big chair with Beth at her\\nfeet, Meg and Amy perched on either arm of the chair, and Jo leaning on\\nthe back, where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter\\nshould happen to be touching.  Very few letters were written in those\\nhard times that were not touching, especially those which fathers sent\\nhome.  In this one little was said of the hardships endured, the\\ndangers faced, or the homesickness conquered. It was a cheerful,\\nhopeful letter, full of lively descriptions of camp life, marches, and\\nmilitary news, and only at the end did the writer\\'s heart over-flow\\nwith fatherly love and longing for the little girls at home.\\n\\n\"Give them all of my dear love and a kiss.  Tell them I think of them\\nby day, pray for them by night, and find my best comfort in their\\naffection at all times.  A year seems very long to wait before I see\\nthem, but remind them that while we wait we may all work, so that these\\nhard days need not be wasted.  I know they will remember all I said to\\nthem, that they will be loving children to you, will do their duty\\nfaithfully, fight their bosom enemies bravely, and conquer themselves\\nso beautifully that when I come back to them I may be fonder and\\nprouder than ever of my little women.\" Everybody sniffed when they came\\nto that part.  Jo wasn\\'t ashamed of the great tear that dropped off the\\nend of her nose, and Amy never minded the rumpling of her curls as she\\nhid her face on her mother\\'s shoulder and sobbed out, \"I am a selfish\\ngirl!  But I\\'ll truly try to be better, so he mayn\\'t be disappointed in\\nme by-and-by.\"\\n\\n\"We all will,\" cried Meg.  \"I think too much of my looks and hate to\\nwork, but won\\'t any more, if I can help it.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll try and be what he loves to call me, \\'a little woman\\' and not be\\nrough and wild, but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere\\nelse,\" said Jo, thinking that keeping her temper at home was a much\\nharder task than facing a rebel or two down South.\\n\\nBeth said nothing, but wiped away her tears with the blue army sock and\\nbegan to knit with all her might, losing no time in doing the duty that\\nlay nearest her, while she resolved in her quiet little soul to be all\\nthat Father hoped to find her when the year brought round the happy\\ncoming home.\\n\\nMrs. March broke the silence that followed Jo\\'s words, by saying in her\\ncheery voice, \"Do you remember how you used to play Pilgrims Progress\\nwhen you were little things?  Nothing delighted you more than to have\\nme tie my piece bags on your backs for burdens, give you hats and\\nsticks and rolls of paper, and let you travel through the house from\\nthe cellar, which was the City of Destruction, up, up, to the housetop,\\nwhere you had all the lovely things you could collect to make a\\nCelestial City.\"\\n\\n\"What fun it was, especially going by the lions, fighting Apollyon, and\\npassing through the valley where the hob-goblins were,\" said Jo.\\n\\n\"I liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled downstairs,\"\\nsaid Meg.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t remember much about it, except that I was afraid of the cellar\\nand the dark entry, and always liked the cake and milk we had up at the\\ntop.  If I wasn\\'t too old for such things, I\\'d rather like to play it\\nover again,\" said Amy, who began to talk of renouncing childish things\\nat the mature age of twelve.\\n\\n\"We never are too old for this, my dear, because it is a play we are\\nplaying all the time in one way or another.  Our burdens are here, our\\nroad is before us, and the longing for goodness and happiness is the\\nguide that leads us through many troubles and mistakes to the peace\\nwhich is a true Celestial City.  Now, my little pilgrims, suppose you\\nbegin again, not in play, but in earnest, and see how far on you can\\nget before Father comes home.\"\\n\\n\"Really, Mother?  Where are our bundles?\" asked Amy, who was a very\\nliteral young lady.\\n\\n\"Each of you told what your burden was just now, except Beth. I rather\\nthink she hasn\\'t got any,\" said her mother.\\n\\n\"Yes, I have.  Mine is dishes and dusters, and envying girls with nice\\npianos, and being afraid of people.\"\\n\\nBeth\\'s bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to laugh, but\\nnobody did, for it would have hurt her feelings very much.\\n\\n\"Let us do it,\" said Meg thoughtfully.  \"It is only another name for\\ntrying to be good, and the story may help us, for though we do want to\\nbe good, it\\'s hard work and we forget, and don\\'t do our best.\"\\n\\n\"We were in the Slough of Despond tonight, and Mother came and pulled\\nus out as Help did in the book.  We ought to have our roll of\\ndirections, like Christian.  What shall we do about that?\" asked Jo,\\ndelighted with the fancy which lent a little romance to the very dull\\ntask of doing her duty.\\n\\n\"Look under your pillows Christmas morning, and you will find your\\nguidebook,\" replied Mrs. March.\\n\\nThey talked over the new plan while old Hannah cleared the table, then\\nout came the four little work baskets, and the needles flew as the\\ngirls made sheets for Aunt March.  It was uninteresting sewing, but\\ntonight no one grumbled.  They adopted Jo\\'s plan of dividing the long\\nseams into four parts, and calling the quarters Europe, Asia, Africa,\\nand America, and in that way got on capitally, especially when they\\ntalked about the different countries as they stitched their way through\\nthem.\\n\\nAt nine they stopped work, and sang, as usual, before they went to bed.\\nNo one but Beth could get much music out of the old piano, but she had\\na way of softly touching the yellow keys and making a pleasant\\naccompaniment to the simple songs they sang.  Meg had a voice like a\\nflute, and she and her mother led the little choir.  Amy chirped like a\\ncricket, and Jo wandered through the airs at her own sweet will, always\\ncoming out at the wrong place with a croak or a quaver that spoiled the\\nmost pensive tune.  They had always done this from the time they could\\nlisp...\\n\\n    Crinkle, crinkle, \\'ittle \\'tar,\\n\\nand it had become a household custom, for the mother was a born singer.\\nThe first sound in the morning was her voice as she went about the\\nhouse singing like a lark, and the last sound at night was the same\\ncheery sound, for the girls never grew too old for that familiar\\nlullaby.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'TWO\\n\\nA MERRY CHRISTMAS\\n\\nJo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of Christmas morning. No\\nstockings hung at the fireplace, and for a moment she felt as much\\ndisappointed as she did long ago, when her little sock fell down\\nbecause it was crammed so full of goodies.  Then she remembered her\\nmother\\'s promise and, slipping her hand under her pillow, drew out a\\nlittle crimson-covered book.  She knew it very well, for it was that\\nbeautiful old story of the best life ever lived, and Jo felt that it\\nwas a true guidebook for any pilgrim going on a long journey.  She woke\\nMeg with a \"Merry Christmas,\" and bade her see what was under her\\npillow.  A green-covered book appeared, with the same picture inside,\\nand a few words written by their mother, which made their one present\\nvery precious in their eyes.  Presently Beth and Amy woke to rummage\\nand find their little books also, one dove-colored, the other blue, and\\nall sat looking at and talking about them, while the east grew rosy\\nwith the coming day.\\n\\nIn spite of her small vanities, Margaret had a sweet and pious nature,\\nwhich unconsciously influenced her sisters, especially Jo, who loved\\nher very tenderly, and obeyed her because her advice was so gently\\ngiven.\\n\\n\"Girls,\" said Meg seriously, looking from the tumbled head beside her\\nto the two little night-capped ones in the room beyond, \"Mother wants\\nus to read and love and mind these books, and we must begin at once.\\nWe used to be faithful about it, but since Father went away and all\\nthis war trouble unsettled us, we have neglected many things.  You can\\ndo as you please, but I shall keep my book on the table here and read a\\nlittle every morning as soon as I wake, for I know it will do me good\\nand help me through the day.\"\\n\\nThen she opened her new book and began to read.  Jo put her arm round\\nher and, leaning cheek to cheek, read also, with the quiet expression\\nso seldom seen on her restless face.\\n\\n\"How good Meg is!  Come, Amy, let\\'s do as they do.  I\\'ll help you with\\nthe hard words, and they\\'ll explain things if we don\\'t understand,\"\\nwhispered Beth, very much impressed by the pretty books and her\\nsisters\\' example.\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad mine is blue,\" said Amy.  and then the rooms were very still\\nwhile the pages were softly turned, and the winter sunshine crept in to\\ntouch the bright heads and serious faces with a Christmas greeting.\\n\\n\"Where is Mother?\" asked Meg, as she and Jo ran down to thank her for\\ntheir gifts, half an hour later.\\n\\n\"Goodness only knows.  Some poor creeter came a-beggin\\', and your ma\\nwent straight off to see what was needed.  There never was such a woman\\nfor givin\\' away vittles and drink, clothes and firin\\',\" replied Hannah,\\nwho had lived with the family since Meg was born, and was considered by\\nthem all more as a friend than a servant.\\n\\n\"She will be back soon, I think, so fry your cakes, and have everything\\nready,\" said Meg, looking over the presents which were collected in a\\nbasket and kept under the sofa, ready to be produced at the proper\\ntime.  \"Why, where is Amy\\'s bottle of cologne?\" she added, as the\\nlittle flask did not appear.\\n\\n\"She took it out a minute ago, and went off with it to put a ribbon on\\nit, or some such notion,\" replied Jo, dancing about the room to take\\nthe first stiffness off the new army slippers.\\n\\n\"How nice my handkerchiefs look, don\\'t they?  Hannah washed and ironed\\nthem for me, and I marked them all myself,\" said Beth, looking proudly\\nat the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her such labor.\\n\\n\"Bless the child!  She\\'s gone and put \\'Mother\\' on them instead of \\'M.\\nMarch\\'.  How funny!\" cried Jo, taking one up.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t that right?  I thought it was better to do it so, because Meg\\'s\\ninitials are M.M., and I don\\'t want anyone to use these but Marmee,\"\\nsaid Beth, looking troubled.\\n\\n\"It\\'s all right, dear, and a very pretty idea, quite sensible too, for\\nno one can ever mistake now.  It will please her very much, I know,\"\\nsaid Meg, with a frown for Jo and a smile for Beth.\\n\\n\"There\\'s Mother.  Hide the basket, quick!\" cried Jo, as a door slammed\\nand steps sounded in the hall.\\n\\nAmy came in hastily, and looked rather abashed when she saw her sisters\\nall waiting for her.\\n\\n\"Where have you been, and what are you hiding behind you?\" asked Meg,\\nsurprised to see, by her hood and cloak, that lazy Amy had been out so\\nearly.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t laugh at me, Jo!  I didn\\'t mean anyone should know till the time\\ncame.  I only meant to change the little bottle for a big one, and I\\ngave all my money to get it, and I\\'m truly trying not to be selfish any\\nmore.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke, Amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap\\none, and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to forget\\nherself that Meg hugged her on the spot, and Jo pronounced her \\'a\\ntrump\\', while Beth ran to the window, and picked her finest rose to\\nornament the stately bottle.\\n\\n\"You see I felt ashamed of my present, after reading and talking about\\nbeing good this morning, so I ran round the corner and changed it the\\nminute I was up, and I\\'m so glad, for mine is the handsomest now.\"\\n\\nAnother bang of the street door sent the basket under the sofa, and the\\ngirls to the table, eager for breakfast.\\n\\n\"Merry Christmas, Marmee!  Many of them!  Thank you for our books.  We\\nread some, and mean to every day,\" they all cried in chorus.\\n\\n\"Merry Christmas, little daughters!  I\\'m glad you began at once, and\\nhope you will keep on.  But I want to say one word before we sit down.\\nNot far away from here lies a poor woman with a little newborn baby.\\nSix children are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing, for they\\nhave no fire.  There is nothing to eat over there, and the oldest boy\\ncame to tell me they were suffering hunger and cold.  My girls, will\\nyou give them your breakfast as a Christmas present?\"\\n\\nThey were all unusually hungry, having waited nearly an hour, and for a\\nminute no one spoke, only a minute, for Jo exclaimed impetuously, \"I\\'m\\nso glad you came before we began!\"\\n\\n\"May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?\" asked\\nBeth eagerly.\\n\\n\"I shall take the cream and the muffings,\" added Amy, heroically giving\\nup the article she most liked.\\n\\nMeg was already covering the buckwheats, and piling the bread into one\\nbig plate.\\n\\n\"I thought you\\'d do it,\" said Mrs. March, smiling as if satisfied. \"You\\nshall all go and help me, and when we come back we will have bread and\\nmilk for breakfast, and make it up at dinnertime.\"\\n\\nThey were soon ready, and the procession set out.  Fortunately it was\\nearly, and they went through back streets, so few people saw them, and\\nno one laughed at the queer party.\\n\\nA poor, bare, miserable room it was, with broken windows, no fire,\\nragged bedclothes, a sick mother, wailing baby, and a group of pale,\\nhungry children cuddled under one old quilt, trying to keep warm.\\n\\nHow the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in.\\n\\n\"Ach, mein Gott!  It is good angels come to us!\" said the poor woman,\\ncrying for joy.\\n\\n\"Funny angels in hoods and mittens,\" said Jo, and set them to laughing.\\n\\nIn a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work\\nthere.  Hannah, who had carried wood, made a fire, and stopped up the\\nbroken panes with old hats and her own cloak.  Mrs. March gave the\\nmother tea and gruel, and comforted her with promises of help, while\\nshe dressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own.  The\\ngirls meantime spread the table, set the children round the fire, and\\nfed them like so many hungry birds, laughing, talking, and trying to\\nunderstand the funny broken English.\\n\\n\"Das ist gut!\"  \"Die Engel-kinder!\" cried the poor things as they ate\\nand warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze. The girls had\\nnever been called angel children before, and thought it very agreeable,\\nespecially Jo, who had been considered a \\'Sancho\\' ever since she was\\nborn.  That was a very happy breakfast, though they didn\\'t get any of\\nit.  And when they went away, leaving comfort behind, I think there\\nwere not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry little\\ngirls who gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves with\\nbread and milk on Christmas morning.\\n\\n\"That\\'s loving our neighbor better than ourselves, and I like it,\" said\\nMeg, as they set out their presents while their mother was upstairs\\ncollecting clothes for the poor Hummels.\\n\\nNot a very splendid show, but there was a great deal of love done up in\\nthe few little bundles, and the tall vase of red roses, white\\nchrysanthemums, and trailing vines, which stood in the middle, gave\\nquite an elegant air to the table.\\n\\n\"She\\'s coming!  Strike up, Beth!  Open the door, Amy!  Three cheers for\\nMarmee!\" cried Jo, prancing about while Meg went to conduct Mother to\\nthe seat of honor.\\n\\nBeth played her gayest march, Amy threw open the door, and Meg enacted\\nescort with great dignity.  Mrs. March was both surprised and touched,\\nand smiled with her eyes full as she examined her presents and read the\\nlittle notes which accompanied them.  The slippers went on at once, a\\nnew handkerchief was slipped into her pocket, well scented with Amy\\'s\\ncologne, the rose was fastened in her bosom, and the nice gloves were\\npronounced a perfect fit.\\n\\nThere was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining, in the\\nsimple, loving fashion which makes these home festivals so pleasant at\\nthe time, so sweet to remember long afterward, and then all fell to\\nwork.\\n\\nThe morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of\\nthe day was devoted to preparations for the evening festivities.  Being\\nstill too young to go often to the theater, and not rich enough to\\nafford any great outlay for private performances, the girls put their\\nwits to work, and necessity being the mother of invention, made\\nwhatever they needed.  Very clever were some of their productions,\\npasteboard guitars, antique lamps made of old-fashioned butter boats\\ncovered with silver paper, gorgeous robes of old cotton, glittering\\nwith tin spangles from a pickle factory, and armor covered with the\\nsame useful diamond shaped bits left in sheets when the lids of\\npreserve pots were cut out.  The big chamber was the scene of many\\ninnocent revels.\\n\\nNo gentleman were admitted, so Jo played male parts to her heart\\'s\\ncontent and took immense satisfaction in a pair of russet leather boots\\ngiven her by a friend, who knew a lady who knew an actor.  These boots,\\nan old foil, and a slashed doublet once used by an artist for some\\npicture, were Jo\\'s chief treasures and appeared on all occasions.  The\\nsmallness of the company made it necessary for the two principal actors\\nto take several parts apiece, and they certainly deserved some credit\\nfor the hard work they did in learning three or four different parts,\\nwhisking in and out of various costumes, and managing the stage\\nbesides.  It was excellent drill for their memories, a harmless\\namusement, and employed many hours which otherwise would have been\\nidle, lonely, or spent in less profitable society.\\n\\nOn Christmas night, a dozen girls piled onto the bed which was the\\ndress circle, and sat before the blue and yellow chintz curtains in a\\nmost flattering state of expectancy.  There was a good deal of rustling\\nand whispering behind the curtain, a trifle of lamp smoke, and an\\noccasional giggle from Amy, who was apt to get hysterical in the\\nexcitement of the moment.  Presently a bell sounded, the curtains flew\\napart, and the _operatic tragedy_ began.\\n\\n\"A gloomy wood,\" according to the one playbill, was represented by a\\nfew shrubs in pots, green baize on the floor, and a cave in the\\ndistance.  This cave was made with a clothes horse for a roof, bureaus\\nfor walls, and in it was a small furnace in full blast, with a black\\npot on it and an old witch bending over it.  The stage was dark and the\\nglow of the furnace had a fine effect, especially as real steam issued\\nfrom the kettle when the witch took off the cover.  A moment was\\nallowed for the first thrill to subside, then Hugo, the villain,\\nstalked in with a clanking sword at his side, a slouching hat, black\\nbeard, mysterious cloak, and the boots.  After pacing to and fro in\\nmuch agitation, he struck his forehead, and burst out in a wild strain,\\nsinging of his hatred for Roderigo, his love for Zara, and his pleasing\\nresolution to kill the one and win the other. The gruff tones of Hugo\\'s\\nvoice, with an occasional shout when his feelings overcame him, were\\nvery impressive, and the audience applauded the moment he paused for\\nbreath.  Bowing with the air of one accustomed to public praise, he\\nstole to the cavern and ordered Hagar to come forth with a commanding,\\n\"What ho, minion! I need thee!\"\\n\\nOut came Meg, with gray horsehair hanging about her face, a red and\\nblack robe, a staff, and cabalistic signs upon her cloak.  Hugo\\ndemanded a potion to make Zara adore him, and one to destroy Roderigo.\\nHagar, in a fine dramatic melody, promised both, and proceeded to call\\nup the spirit who would bring the love philter.\\n\\n    Hither, hither, from thy home,\\n    Airy sprite, I bid thee come!\\n    Born of roses, fed on dew,\\n    Charms and potions canst thou brew?\\n    Bring me here, with elfin speed,\\n    The fragrant philter which I need.\\n    Make it sweet and swift and strong,\\n    Spirit, answer now my song!\\n\\nA soft strain of music sounded, and then at the back of the cave\\nappeared a little figure in cloudy white, with glittering wings, golden\\nhair, and a garland of roses on its head.  Waving a wand, it sang...\\n\\n    Hither I come,\\n    From my airy home,\\n    Afar in the silver moon.\\n    Take the magic spell,\\n    And use it well,\\n    Or its power will vanish soon!\\n\\nAnd dropping a small, gilded bottle at the witch\\'s feet, the spirit\\nvanished.  Another chant from Hagar produced another apparition, not a\\nlovely one, for with a bang an ugly black imp appeared and, having\\ncroaked a reply, tossed a dark bottle at Hugo and disappeared with a\\nmocking laugh.  Having warbled his thanks and put the potions in his\\nboots, Hugo departed, and Hagar informed the audience that as he had\\nkilled a few of her friends in times past, she had cursed him, and\\nintends to thwart his plans, and be revenged on him.  Then the curtain\\nfell, and the audience reposed and ate candy while discussing the\\nmerits of the play.\\n\\nA good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose again, but\\nwhen it became evident what a masterpiece of stage carpentery had been\\ngot up, no one murmured at the delay.  It was truly superb. A tower\\nrose to the ceiling, halfway up appeared a window with a lamp burning\\nin it, and behind the white curtain appeared Zara in a lovely blue and\\nsilver dress, waiting for Roderigo.  He came in gorgeous array, with\\nplumed cap, red cloak, chestnut lovelocks, a guitar, and the boots, of\\ncourse.  Kneeling at the foot of the tower, he sang a serenade in\\nmelting tones.  Zara replied and, after a musical dialogue, consented\\nto fly.  Then came the grand effect of the play.  Roderigo produced a\\nrope ladder, with five steps to it, threw up one end, and invited Zara\\nto descend.  Timidly she crept from her lattice, put her hand on\\nRoderigo\\'s shoulder, and was about to leap gracefully down when \"Alas!\\nAlas for Zara!\" she forgot her train.  It caught in the window, the\\ntower tottered, leaned forward, fell with a crash, and buried the\\nunhappy lovers in the ruins.\\n\\nA universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly from the\\nwreck and a golden head emerged, exclaiming, \"I told you so!  I told\\nyou so!\"  With wonderful presence of mind, Don Pedro, the cruel sire,\\nrushed in, dragged out his daughter, with a hasty aside...\\n\\n\"Don\\'t laugh!  Act as if it was all right!\" and, ordering Roderigo up,\\nbanished him from the kingdom with wrath and scorn. Though decidedly\\nshaken by the fall from the tower upon him, Roderigo defied the old\\ngentleman and refused to stir.  This dauntless example fired Zara.  She\\nalso defied her sire, and he ordered them both to the deepest dungeons\\nof the castle.  A stout little retainer came in with chains and led\\nthem away, looking very much frightened and evidently forgetting the\\nspeech he ought to have made.\\n\\nAct third was the castle hall, and here Hagar appeared, having come to\\nfree the lovers and finish Hugo.  She hears him coming and hides, sees\\nhim put the potions into two cups of wine and bid the timid little\\nservant, \"Bear them to the captives in their cells, and tell them I\\nshall come anon.\"  The servant takes Hugo aside to tell him something,\\nand Hagar changes the cups for two others which are harmless.\\nFerdinando, the \\'minion\\', carries them away, and Hagar puts back the\\ncup which holds the poison meant for Roderigo. Hugo, getting thirsty\\nafter a long warble, drinks it, loses his wits, and after a good deal\\nof clutching and stamping, falls flat and dies, while Hagar informs him\\nwhat she has done in a song of exquisite power and melody.\\n\\nThis was a truly thrilling scene, though some persons might have\\nthought that the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long red hair\\nrather marred the effect of the villain\\'s death.  He was called before\\nthe curtain, and with great propriety appeared, leading Hagar, whose\\nsinging was considered more wonderful than all the rest of the\\nperformance put together.\\n\\nAct fourth displayed the despairing Roderigo on the point of stabbing\\nhimself because he has been told that Zara has deserted him. Just as\\nthe dagger is at his heart, a lovely song is sung under his window,\\ninforming him that Zara is true but in danger, and he can save her if\\nhe will.  A key is thrown in, which unlocks the door, and in a spasm of\\nrapture he tears off his chains and rushes away to find and rescue his\\nlady love.\\n\\nAct fifth opened with a stormy scene between Zara and Don Pedro. He\\nwishes her to go into a convent, but she won\\'t hear of it, and after a\\ntouching appeal, is about to faint when Roderigo dashes in and demands\\nher hand.  Don Pedro refuses, because he is not rich. They shout and\\ngesticulate tremendously but cannot agree, and Rodrigo is about to bear\\naway the exhausted Zara, when the timid servant enters with a letter\\nand a bag from Hagar, who has mysteriously disappeared.  The latter\\ninforms the party that she bequeaths untold wealth to the young pair\\nand an awful doom to Don Pedro, if he doesn\\'t make them happy.  The bag\\nis opened, and several quarts of tin money shower down upon the stage\\ntill it is quite glorified with the glitter.  This entirely softens the\\nstern sire.  He consents without a murmur, all join in a joyful chorus,\\nand the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive Don Pedro\\'s\\nblessing in attitudes of the most romantic grace.\\n\\nTumultuous applause followed but received an unexpected check, for the\\ncot bed, on which the dress circle was built, suddenly shut up and\\nextinguished the enthusiastic audience.  Roderigo and Don Pedro flew to\\nthe rescue, and all were taken out unhurt, though many were speechless\\nwith laughter.  The excitement had hardly subsided when Hannah\\nappeared, with \"Mrs. March\\'s compliments, and would the ladies walk\\ndown to supper.\"\\n\\nThis was a surprise even to the actors, and when they saw the table,\\nthey looked at one another in rapturous amazement.  It was like Marmee\\nto get up a little treat for them, but anything so fine as this was\\nunheard of since the departed days of plenty.  There was ice cream,\\nactually two dishes of it, pink and white, and cake and fruit and\\ndistracting French bonbons and, in the middle of the table, four great\\nbouquets of hot house flowers.\\n\\nIt quite took their breath away, and they stared first at the table and\\nthen at their mother, who looked as if she enjoyed it immensely.\\n\\n\"Is it fairies?\" asked Amy.\\n\\n\"Santa Claus,\" said Beth.\\n\\n\"Mother did it.\" And Meg smiled her sweetest, in spite of her gray\\nbeard and white eyebrows.\\n\\n\"Aunt March had a good fit and sent the supper,\" cried Jo, with a\\nsudden inspiration.\\n\\n\"All wrong.  Old Mr. Laurence sent it,\" replied Mrs. March.\\n\\n\"The Laurence boy\\'s grandfather! What in the world put such a thing\\ninto his head?  We don\\'t know him!\" exclaimed Meg.\\n\\n\"Hannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party. He is an\\nodd old gentleman, but that pleased him.  He knew my father years ago,\\nand he sent me a polite note this afternoon, saying he hoped I would\\nallow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children by sending\\nthem a few trifles in honor of the day.  I could not refuse, and so you\\nhave a little feast at night to make up for the bread-and-milk\\nbreakfast.\"\\n\\n\"That boy put it into his head, I know he did!  He\\'s a capital fellow,\\nand I wish we could get acquainted.  He looks as if he\\'d like to know\\nus but he\\'s bashful, and Meg is so prim she won\\'t let me speak to him\\nwhen we pass,\" said Jo, as the plates went round, and the ice began to\\nmelt out of sight, with ohs and ahs of satisfaction.\\n\\n\"You mean the people who live in the big house next door, don\\'t you?\"\\nasked one of the girls.  \"My mother knows old Mr. Laurence, but says\\nhe\\'s very proud and doesn\\'t like to mix with his neighbors. He keeps\\nhis grandson shut up, when he isn\\'t riding or walking with his tutor,\\nand makes him study very hard.  We invited him to our party, but he\\ndidn\\'t come.  Mother says he\\'s very nice, though he never speaks to us\\ngirls.\"\\n\\n\"Our cat ran away once, and he brought her back, and we talked over the\\nfence, and were getting on capitally, all about cricket, and so on,\\nwhen he saw Meg coming, and walked off.  I mean to know him some day,\\nfor he needs fun, I\\'m sure he does,\" said Jo decidedly.\\n\\n\"I like his manners, and he looks like a little gentleman, so I\\'ve no\\nobjection to your knowing him, if a proper opportunity comes. He\\nbrought the flowers himself, and I should have asked him in, if I had\\nbeen sure what was going on upstairs.  He looked so wistful as he went\\naway, hearing the frolic and evidently having none of his own.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a mercy you didn\\'t, Mother!\" laughed Jo, looking at her boots.\\n\"But we\\'ll have another play sometime that he can see.  Perhaps he\\'ll\\nhelp act.  Wouldn\\'t that be jolly?\"\\n\\n\"I never had such a fine bouquet before!  How pretty it is!\" And Meg\\nexamined her flowers with great interest.\\n\\n\"They are lovely.  But Beth\\'s roses are sweeter to me,\" said Mrs.\\nMarch, smelling the half-dead posy in her belt.\\n\\nBeth nestled up to her, and whispered softly, \"I wish I could send my\\nbunch to Father.  I\\'m afraid he isn\\'t having such a merry Christmas as\\nwe are.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'THREE\\n\\nTHE LAURENCE BOY\\n\\n\"Jo!  Jo!  Where are you?\" cried Meg at the foot of the garret stairs.\\n\\n\"Here!\" answered a husky voice from above, and, running up, Meg found\\nher sister eating apples and crying over the Heir of Redclyffe, wrapped\\nup in a comforter on an old three-legged sofa by the sunny window.\\nThis was Jo\\'s favorite refuge, and here she loved to retire with half a\\ndozen russets and a nice book, to enjoy the quiet and the society of a\\npet rat who lived near by and didn\\'t mind her a particle.  As Meg\\nappeared, Scrabble whisked into his hole.  Jo shook the tears off her\\ncheeks and waited to hear the news.\\n\\n\"Such fun!  Only see!  A regular note of invitation from Mrs. Gardiner\\nfor tomorrow night!\" cried Meg, waving the precious paper and then\\nproceeding to read it with girlish delight.\\n\\n\"\\'Mrs. Gardiner would be happy to see Miss March and Miss Josephine at\\na little dance on New Year\\'s Eve.\\' Marmee is willing we should go, now\\nwhat shall we wear?\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s the use of asking that, when you know we shall wear our\\npoplins, because we haven\\'t got anything else?\" answered Jo with her\\nmouth full.\\n\\n\"If I only had a silk!\" sighed Meg.  \"Mother says I may when I\\'m\\neighteen perhaps, but two years is an everlasting time to wait.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure our pops look like silk, and they are nice enough for us.\\nYours is as good as new, but I forgot the burn and the tear in mine.\\nWhatever shall I do?  The burn shows badly, and I can\\'t take any out.\"\\n\\n\"You must sit still all you can and keep your back out of sight. The\\nfront is all right.  I shall have a new ribbon for my hair, and Marmee\\nwill lend me her little pearl pin, and my new slippers are lovely, and\\nmy gloves will do, though they aren\\'t as nice as I\\'d like.\"\\n\\n\"Mine are spoiled with lemonade, and I can\\'t get any new ones, so I\\nshall have to go without,\" said Jo, who never troubled herself much\\nabout dress.\\n\\n\"You must have gloves, or I won\\'t go,\" cried Meg decidedly. \"Gloves are\\nmore important than anything else.  You can\\'t dance without them, and\\nif you don\\'t I should be so mortified.\"\\n\\n\"Then I\\'ll stay still.  I don\\'t care much for company dancing. It\\'s no\\nfun to go sailing round.  I like to fly about and cut capers.\"\\n\\n\"You can\\'t ask Mother for new ones, they are so expensive, and you are\\nso careless.  She said when you spoiled the others that she shouldn\\'t\\nget you any more this winter.  Can\\'t you make them do?\"\\n\\n\"I can hold them crumpled up in my hand, so no one will know how\\nstained they are.  That\\'s all I can do.  No!  I\\'ll tell you how we can\\nmanage, each wear one good one and carry a bad one.  Don\\'t you see?\"\\n\\n\"Your hands are bigger than mine, and you will stretch my glove\\ndreadfully,\" began Meg, whose gloves were a tender point with her.\\n\\n\"Then I\\'ll go without.  I don\\'t care what people say!\" cried Jo, taking\\nup her book.\\n\\n\"You may have it, you may!  Only don\\'t stain it, and do behave nicely.\\nDon\\'t put your hands behind you, or stare, or say \\'Christopher\\nColumbus!\\' will you?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t worry about me.  I\\'ll be as prim as I can and not get into any\\nscrapes, if I can help it.  Now go and answer your note, and let me\\nfinish this splendid story.\"\\n\\nSo Meg went away to \\'accept with thanks\\', look over her dress, and sing\\nblithely as she did up her one real lace frill, while Jo finished her\\nstory, her four apples, and had a game of romps with Scrabble.\\n\\nOn New Year\\'s Eve the parlor was deserted, for the two younger girls\\nplayed dressing maids and the two elder were absorbed in the\\nall-important business of \\'getting ready for the party\\'.  Simple as the\\ntoilets were, there was a great deal of running up and down, laughing\\nand talking, and at one time a strong smell of burned hair pervaded the\\nhouse.  Meg wanted a few curls about her face, and Jo undertook to\\npinch the papered locks with a pair of hot tongs.\\n\\n\"Ought they to smoke like that?\" asked Beth from her perch on the bed.\\n\\n\"It\\'s the dampness drying,\" replied Jo.\\n\\n\"What a queer smell!  It\\'s like burned feathers,\" observed Amy,\\nsmoothing her own pretty curls with a superior air.\\n\\n\"There, now I\\'ll take off the papers and you\\'ll see a cloud of little\\nringlets,\" said Jo, putting down the tongs.\\n\\nShe did take off the papers, but no cloud of ringlets appeared, for the\\nhair came with the papers, and the horrified hairdresser laid a row of\\nlittle scorched bundles on the bureau before her victim.\\n\\n\"Oh, oh, oh! What have you done?  I\\'m spoiled!  I can\\'t go!  My hair,\\noh, my hair!\" wailed Meg, looking with despair at the uneven frizzle on\\nher forehead.\\n\\n\"Just my luck!  You shouldn\\'t have asked me to do it.  I always spoil\\neverything.  I\\'m so sorry, but the tongs were too hot, and so I\\'ve made\\na mess,\" groaned poor Jo, regarding the little black pancakes with\\ntears of regret.\\n\\n\"It isn\\'t spoiled.  Just frizzle it, and tie your ribbon so the ends\\ncome on your forehead a bit, and it will look like the last fashion.\\nI\\'ve seen many girls do it so,\" said Amy consolingly.\\n\\n\"Serves me right for trying to be fine.  I wish I\\'d let my hair alone,\"\\ncried Meg petulantly.\\n\\n\"So do I, it was so smooth and pretty.  But it will soon grow out\\nagain,\" said Beth, coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep.\\n\\nAfter various lesser mishaps, Meg was finished at last, and by the\\nunited exertions of the entire family Jo\\'s hair was got up and her\\ndress on.  They looked very well in their simple suits, Meg\\'s in\\nsilvery drab, with a blue velvet snood, lace frills, and the pearl pin.\\nJo in maroon, with a stiff, gentlemanly linen collar, and a white\\nchrysanthemum or two for her only ornament. Each put on one nice light\\nglove, and carried one soiled one, and all pronounced the effect \"quite\\neasy and fine\".  Meg\\'s high-heeled slippers were very tight and hurt\\nher, though she would not own it, and Jo\\'s nineteen hairpins all seemed\\nstuck straight into her head, which was not exactly comfortable, but,\\ndear me, let us be elegant or die.\\n\\n\"Have a good time, dearies!\" said Mrs. March, as the sisters went\\ndaintily down the walk.  \"Don\\'t eat much supper, and come away at\\neleven when I send Hannah for you.\"  As the gate clashed behind them, a\\nvoice cried from a window...\\n\\n\"Girls, girls!  Have you you both got nice pocket handkerchiefs?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, spandy nice, and Meg has cologne on hers,\" cried Jo, adding\\nwith a laugh as they went on, \"I do believe Marmee would ask that if we\\nwere all running away from an earthquake.\"\\n\\n\"It is one of her aristocratic tastes, and quite proper, for a real\\nlady is always known by neat boots, gloves, and handkerchief,\" replied\\nMeg, who had a good many little \\'aristocratic tastes\\' of her own.\\n\\n\"Now don\\'t forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight, Jo. Is my sash\\nright?  And does my hair look very bad?\" said Meg, as she turned from\\nthe glass in Mrs. Gardiner\\'s dressing room after a prolonged prink.\\n\\n\"I know I shall forget.  If you see me doing anything wrong, just\\nremind me by a wink, will you?\" returned Jo, giving her collar a twitch\\nand her head a hasty brush.\\n\\n\"No, winking isn\\'t ladylike.  I\\'ll lift my eyebrows if any thing is\\nwrong, and nod if you are all right.  Now hold your shoulder straight,\\nand take short steps, and don\\'t shake hands if you are introduced to\\nanyone.  It isn\\'t the thing.\"\\n\\n\"How do you learn all the proper ways?  I never can.  Isn\\'t that music\\ngay?\"\\n\\nDown they went, feeling a trifle timid, for they seldom went to\\nparties, and informal as this little gathering was, it was an event to\\nthem.  Mrs. Gardiner, a stately old lady, greeted them kindly and\\nhanded them over to the eldest of her six daughters. Meg knew Sallie\\nand was at her ease very soon, but Jo, who didn\\'t care much for girls\\nor girlish gossip, stood about, with her back carefully against the\\nwall, and felt as much out of place as a colt in a flower garden.  Half\\na dozen jovial lads were talking about skates in another part of the\\nroom, and she longed to go and join them, for skating was one of the\\njoys of her life.  She telegraphed her wish to Meg, but the eyebrows\\nwent up so alarmingly that she dared not stir.  No one came to talk to\\nher, and one by one the group dwindled away till she was left alone.\\nShe could not roam about and amuse herself, for the burned breadth\\nwould show, so she stared at people rather forlornly till the dancing\\nbegan.  Meg was asked at once, and the tight slippers tripped about so\\nbriskly that none would have guessed the pain their wearer suffered\\nsmilingly.  Jo saw a big red headed youth approaching her corner, and\\nfearing he meant to engage her, she slipped into a curtained recess,\\nintending to peep and enjoy herself in peace.  Unfortunately, another\\nbashful person had chosen the same refuge, for, as the curtain fell\\nbehind her, she found herself face to face with the \\'Laurence boy\\'.\\n\\n\"Dear me, I didn\\'t know anyone was here!\" stammered Jo, preparing to\\nback out as speedily as she had bounced in.\\n\\nBut the boy laughed and said pleasantly, though he looked a little\\nstartled, \"Don\\'t mind me, stay if you like.\"\\n\\n\"Shan\\'t I disturb you?\"\\n\\n\"Not a bit.  I only came here because I don\\'t know many people and felt\\nrather strange at first, you know.\"\\n\\n\"So did I.  Don\\'t go away, please, unless you\\'d rather.\"\\n\\nThe boy sat down again and looked at his pumps, till Jo said, trying to\\nbe polite and easy, \"I think I\\'ve had the pleasure of seeing you\\nbefore.  You live near us, don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Next door.\"  And he looked up and laughed outright, for Jo\\'s prim\\nmanner was rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted about\\ncricket when he brought the cat home.\\n\\nThat put Jo at her ease and she laughed too, as she said, in her\\nheartiest way, \"We did have such a good time over your nice Christmas\\npresent.\"\\n\\n\"Grandpa sent it.\"\\n\\n\"But you put it into his head, didn\\'t you, now?\"\\n\\n\"How is your cat, Miss March?\" asked the boy, trying to look sober\\nwhile his black eyes shone with fun.\\n\\n\"Nicely, thank you, Mr. Laurence.  But I am not Miss March, I\\'m only\\nJo,\" returned the young lady.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not Mr. Laurence, I\\'m only Laurie.\"\\n\\n\"Laurie Laurence, what an odd name.\"\\n\\n\"My first name is Theodore, but I don\\'t like it, for the fellows called\\nme Dora, so I made them say Laurie instead.\"\\n\\n\"I hate my name, too, so sentimental!  I wish every one would say Jo\\ninstead of Josephine.  How did you make the boys stop calling you Dora?\"\\n\\n\"I thrashed \\'em.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t thrash Aunt March, so I suppose I shall have to bear it.\"  And\\nJo resigned herself with a sigh.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you like to dance, Miss Jo?\" asked Laurie, looking as if he\\nthought the name suited her.\\n\\n\"I like it well enough if there is plenty of room, and everyone is\\nlively.  In a place like this I\\'m sure to upset something, tread on\\npeople\\'s toes, or do something dreadful, so I keep out of mischief and\\nlet Meg sail about.  Don\\'t you dance?\"\\n\\n\"Sometimes.  You see I\\'ve been abroad a good many years, and haven\\'t\\nbeen into company enough yet to know how you do things here.\"\\n\\n\"Abroad!\" cried Jo.  \"Oh, tell me about it!  I love dearly to hear\\npeople describe their travels.\"\\n\\nLaurie didn\\'t seem to know where to begin, but Jo\\'s eager questions\\nsoon set him going, and he told her how he had been at school in Vevay,\\nwhere the boys never wore hats and had a fleet of boats on the lake,\\nand for holiday fun went on walking trips about Switzerland with their\\nteachers.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t I wish I\\'d been there!\" cried Jo.  \"Did you go to Paris?\"\\n\\n\"We spent last winter there.\"\\n\\n\"Can you talk French?\"\\n\\n\"We were not allowed to speak anything else at Vevay.\"\\n\\n\"Do say some!  I can read it, but can\\'t pronounce.\"\\n\\n\"Quel nom a cette jeune demoiselle en les pantoufles jolis?\"\\n\\n\"How nicely you do it!  Let me see ... you said, \\'Who is the young lady\\nin the pretty slippers\\', didn\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Oui, mademoiselle.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s my sister Margaret, and you knew it was!  Do you think she is\\npretty?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, she makes me think of the German girls, she looks so fresh and\\nquiet, and dances like a lady.\"\\n\\nJo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister, and\\nstored it up to repeat to Meg.  Both peeped and criticized and chatted\\ntill they felt like old acquaintances.  Laurie\\'s bashfulness soon wore\\noff, for Jo\\'s gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him at his ease, and\\nJo was her merry self again, because her dress was forgotten and nobody\\nlifted their eyebrows at her.  She liked the \\'Laurence boy\\' better than\\never and took several good looks at him, so that she might describe him\\nto the girls, for they had no brothers, very few male cousins, and boys\\nwere almost unknown creatures to them.\\n\\n\"Curly black hair, brown skin, big black eyes, handsome nose, fine\\nteeth, small hands and feet, taller than I am, very polite, for a boy,\\nand altogether jolly.  Wonder how old he is?\"\\n\\nIt was on the tip of Jo\\'s tongue to ask, but she checked herself in\\ntime and, with unusual tact, tried to find out in a round-about way.\\n\\n\"I suppose you are going to college soon?  I see you pegging away at\\nyour books, no, I mean studying hard.\"  And Jo blushed at the dreadful\\n\\'pegging\\' which had escaped her.\\n\\nLaurie smiled but didn\\'t seem shocked, and answered with a shrug.  \"Not\\nfor a year or two.  I won\\'t go before seventeen, anyway.\"\\n\\n\"Aren\\'t you but fifteen?\" asked Jo, looking at the tall lad, whom she\\nhad imagined seventeen already.\\n\\n\"Sixteen, next month.\"\\n\\n\"How I wish I was going to college!  You don\\'t look as if you liked it.\"\\n\\n\"I hate it!  Nothing but grinding or skylarking.  And I don\\'t like the\\nway fellows do either, in this country.\"\\n\\n\"What do you like?\"\\n\\n\"To live in Italy, and to enjoy myself in my own way.\"\\n\\nJo wanted very much to ask what his own way was, but his black brows\\nlooked rather threatening as he knit them, so she changed the subject\\nby saying, as her foot kept time, \"That\\'s a splendid polka!  Why don\\'t\\nyou go and try it?\"\\n\\n\"If you will come too,\" he answered, with a gallant little bow.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t, for I told Meg I wouldn\\'t, because...\" There Jo stopped, and\\nlooked undecided whether to tell or to laugh.\\n\\n\"Because, what?\"\\n\\n\"You won\\'t tell?\"\\n\\n\"Never!\"\\n\\n\"Well, I have a bad trick of standing before the fire, and so I burn my\\nfrocks, and I scorched this one, and though it\\'s nicely mended, it\\nshows, and Meg told me to keep still so no one would see it.  You may\\nlaugh, if you want to.  It is funny, I know.\"\\n\\nBut Laurie didn\\'t laugh.  He only looked down a minute, and the\\nexpression of his face puzzled Jo when he said very gently, \"Never mind\\nthat.  I\\'ll tell you how we can manage.  There\\'s a long hall out there,\\nand we can dance grandly, and no one will see us. Please come.\"\\n\\nJo thanked him and gladly went, wishing she had two neat gloves when\\nshe saw the nice, pearl-colored ones her partner wore.  The hall was\\nempty, and they had a grand polka, for Laurie danced well, and taught\\nher the German step, which delighted Jo, being full of swing and\\nspring.  When the music stopped, they sat down on the stairs to get\\ntheir breath, and Laurie was in the midst of an account of a students\\'\\nfestival at Heidelberg when Meg appeared in search of her sister.  She\\nbeckoned, and Jo reluctantly followed her into a side room, where she\\nfound her on a sofa, holding her foot, and looking pale.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve sprained my ankle.  That stupid high heel turned and gave me a\\nsad wrench.  It aches so, I can hardly stand, and I don\\'t know how I\\'m\\never going to get home,\" she said, rocking to and fro in pain.\\n\\n\"I knew you\\'d hurt your feet with those silly shoes.  I\\'m sorry.  But I\\ndon\\'t see what you can do, except get a carriage, or stay here all\\nnight,\" answered Jo, softly rubbing the poor ankle as she spoke.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t have a carriage without its costing ever so much.  I dare say\\nI can\\'t get one at all, for most people come in their own, and it\\'s a\\nlong way to the stable, and no one to send.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll go.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed!  It\\'s past nine, and dark as Egypt.  I can\\'t stop here,\\nfor the house is full.  Sallie has some girls staying with her. I\\'ll\\nrest till Hannah comes, and then do the best I can.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll ask Laurie.  He will go,\" said Jo, looking relieved as the idea\\noccurred to her.\\n\\n\"Mercy, no!  Don\\'t ask or tell anyone.  Get me my rubbers, and put\\nthese slippers with our things.  I can\\'t dance anymore, but as soon as\\nsupper is over, watch for Hannah and tell me the minute she comes.\"\\n\\n\"They are going out to supper now.  I\\'ll stay with you.  I\\'d rather.\"\\n\\n\"No, dear, run along, and bring me some coffee.  I\\'m so tired I can\\'t\\nstir.\"\\n\\nSo Meg reclined, with rubbers well hidden, and Jo went blundering away\\nto the dining room, which she found after going into a china closet,\\nand opening the door of a room where old Mr. Gardiner was taking a\\nlittle private refreshment.  Making a dart at the table, she secured\\nthe coffee, which she immediately spilled, thereby making the front of\\nher dress as bad as the back.\\n\\n\"Oh, dear, what a blunderbuss I am!\" exclaimed Jo, finishing Meg\\'s\\nglove by scrubbing her gown with it.\\n\\n\"Can I help you?\" said a friendly voice.  And there was Laurie, with a\\nfull cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other.\\n\\n\"I was trying to get something for Meg, who is very tired, and someone\\nshook me, and here I am in a nice state,\" answered Jo, glancing\\ndismally from the stained skirt to the coffee-colored glove.\\n\\n\"Too bad!   I was looking for someone to give this to.  May I take it\\nto your sister?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, thank you!  I\\'ll show you where she is.  I don\\'t offer to take it\\nmyself, for I should only get into another scrape if I did.\"\\n\\nJo led the way, and as if used to waiting on ladies, Laurie drew up a\\nlittle table, brought a second installment of coffee and ice for Jo,\\nand was so obliging that even particular Meg pronounced him a \\'nice\\nboy\\'.  They had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes, and were in\\nthe midst of a quiet game of _Buzz_, with two or three other young\\npeople who had strayed in, when Hannah appeared.  Meg forgot her foot\\nand rose so quickly that she was forced to catch hold of Jo, with an\\nexclamation of pain.\\n\\n\"Hush!  Don\\'t say anything,\" she whispered, adding aloud, \"It\\'s\\nnothing.  I turned my foot a little, that\\'s all,\" and limped upstairs\\nto put her things on.\\n\\nHannah scolded, Meg cried, and Jo was at her wits\\' end, till she\\ndecided to take things into her own hands.  Slipping out, she ran down\\nand, finding a servant, asked if he could get her a carriage. It\\nhappened to be a hired waiter who knew nothing about the neighborhood\\nand Jo was looking round for help when Laurie, who had heard what she\\nsaid, came up and offered his grandfather\\'s carriage, which had just\\ncome for him, he said.\\n\\n\"It\\'s so early!  You can\\'t mean to go yet?\" began Jo, looking relieved\\nbut hesitating to accept the offer.\\n\\n\"I always go early, I do, truly!  Please let me take you home. It\\'s all\\non my way, you know, and it rains, they say.\"\\n\\nThat settled it, and telling him of Meg\\'s mishap, Jo gratefully\\naccepted and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party.  Hannah\\nhated rain as much as a cat does so she made no trouble, and they\\nrolled away in the luxurious close carriage, feeling very festive and\\nelegant.  Laurie went on the box so Meg could keep her foot up, and the\\ngirls talked over their party in freedom.\\n\\n\"I had a capital time.  Did you?\" asked Jo, rumpling up her hair, and\\nmaking herself comfortable.\\n\\n\"Yes, till I hurt myself.  Sallie\\'s friend, Annie Moffat, took a fancy\\nto me, and asked me to come and spend a week with her when Sallie does.\\nShe is going in the spring when the opera comes, and it will be\\nperfectly splendid, if Mother only lets me go,\" answered Meg, cheering\\nup at the thought.\\n\\n\"I saw you dancing with the red headed man I ran away from.  Was he\\nnice?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, very!  His hair is auburn, not red, and he was very polite, and I\\nhad a delicious redowa with him.\"\\n\\n\"He looked like a grasshopper in a fit when he did the new step. Laurie\\nand I couldn\\'t help laughing.  Did you hear us?\"\\n\\n\"No, but it was very rude.  What were you about all that time, hidden\\naway there?\"\\n\\nJo told her adventures, and by the time she had finished they were at\\nhome.  With many thanks, they said good night and crept in, hoping to\\ndisturb no one, but the instant their door creaked, two little\\nnightcaps bobbed up, and two sleepy but eager voices cried out...\\n\\n\"Tell about the party!  Tell about the party!\"\\n\\nWith what Meg called \\'a great want of manners\\' Jo had saved some\\nbonbons for the little girls, and they soon subsided, after hearing the\\nmost thrilling events of the evening.\\n\\n\"I declare, it really seems like being a fine young lady, to come home\\nfrom the party in a carriage and sit in my dressing gown with a maid to\\nwait on me,\" said Meg, as Jo bound up her foot with arnica and brushed\\nher hair.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we\\ndo, in spite of our burned hair, old gowns, one glove apiece and tight\\nslippers that sprain our ankles when we are silly enough to wear them.\"\\nAnd I think Jo was quite right.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'FOUR\\n\\nBURDENS\\n\\n\"Oh, dear, how hard it does seem to take up our packs and go on,\"\\nsighed Meg the morning after the party, for now the holidays were over,\\nthe week of merrymaking did not fit her for going on easily with the\\ntask she never liked.\\n\\n\"I wish it was Christmas or New Year\\'s all the time. Wouldn\\'t it be\\nfun?\" answered Jo, yawning dismally.\\n\\n\"We shouldn\\'t enjoy ourselves half so much as we do now. But it does\\nseem so nice to have little suppers and bouquets, and go to parties,\\nand drive home, and read and rest, and not work.  It\\'s like other\\npeople, you know, and I always envy girls who do such things, I\\'m so\\nfond of luxury,\" said Meg, trying to decide which of two shabby gowns\\nwas the least shabby.\\n\\n\"Well, we can\\'t have it, so don\\'t let us grumble but shoulder our\\nbundles and trudge along as cheerfully as Marmee does.  I\\'m sure Aunt\\nMarch is a regular Old Man of the Sea to me, but I suppose when I\\'ve\\nlearned to carry her without complaining, she will tumble off, or get\\nso light that I shan\\'t mind her.\"\\n\\nThis idea tickled Jo\\'s fancy and put her in good spirits, but Meg\\ndidn\\'t brighten, for her burden, consisting of four spoiled children,\\nseemed heavier than ever. She had not heart enough even to make herself\\npretty as usual by putting on a blue neck ribbon and dressing her hair\\nin the most becoming way.\\n\\n\"Where\\'s the use of looking nice, when no one sees me but those cross\\nmidgets, and no one cares whether I\\'m pretty or not?\" she muttered,\\nshutting her drawer with a jerk.  \"I shall have to toil and moil all my\\ndays, with only little bits of fun now and then, and get old and ugly\\nand sour, because I\\'m poor and can\\'t enjoy my life as other girls do.\\nIt\\'s a shame!\"\\n\\nSo Meg went down, wearing an injured look, and wasn\\'t at all agreeable\\nat breakfast time.  Everyone seemed rather out of sorts and inclined to\\ncroak.\\n\\nBeth had a headache and lay on the sofa, trying to comfort herself with\\nthe cat and three kittens.  Amy was fretting because her lessons were\\nnot learned, and she couldn\\'t find her rubbers.  Jo would whistle and\\nmake a great racket getting ready.\\n\\nMrs. March was very busy trying to finish a letter, which must go at\\nonce, and Hannah had the grumps, for being up late didn\\'t suit her.\\n\\n\"There never was such a cross family!\" cried Jo, losing her temper when\\nshe had upset an inkstand, broken both boot lacings, and sat down upon\\nher hat.\\n\\n\"You\\'re the crossest person in it!\" returned Amy, washing out the sum\\nthat was all wrong with the tears that had fallen on her slate.\\n\\n\"Beth, if you don\\'t keep these horrid cats down cellar I\\'ll have them\\ndrowned,\" exclaimed Meg angrily as she tried to get rid of the kitten\\nwhich had scrambled up her back and stuck like a burr just out of reach.\\n\\nJo laughed, Meg scolded, Beth implored, and Amy wailed because she\\ncouldn\\'t remember how much nine times twelve was.\\n\\n\"Girls, girls, do be quiet one minute!  I must get this off by the\\nearly mail, and you drive me distracted with your worry,\" cried Mrs.\\nMarch, crossing out the third spoiled sentence in her letter.\\n\\nThere was a momentary lull, broken by Hannah, who stalked in, laid two\\nhot turnovers on the table, and stalked out again. These turnovers were\\nan institution, and the girls called them \\'muffs\\', for they had no\\nothers and found the hot pies very comforting to their hands on cold\\nmornings.\\n\\nHannah never forgot to make them, no matter how busy or grumpy she\\nmight be, for the walk was long and bleak. The poor things got no other\\nlunch and were seldom home before two.\\n\\n\"Cuddle your cats and get over your headache, Bethy. Goodbye, Marmee.\\nWe are a set of rascals this morning, but we\\'ll come home regular\\nangels.  Now then, Meg!\"  And Jo tramped away, feeling that the\\npilgrims were not setting out as they ought to do.\\n\\nThey always looked back before turning the corner, for their mother was\\nalways at the window to nod and smile, and wave her hand to them.\\nSomehow it seemed as if they couldn\\'t have got through the day without\\nthat, for whatever their mood might be, the last glimpse of that\\nmotherly face was sure to affect them like sunshine.\\n\\n\"If Marmee shook her fist instead of kissing her hand to us, it would\\nserve us right, for more ungrateful wretches than we are were never\\nseen,\" cried Jo, taking a remorseful satisfaction in the snowy walk and\\nbitter wind.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t use such dreadful expressions,\" replied Meg from the depths of\\nthe veil in which she had shrouded herself like a nun sick of the world.\\n\\n\"I like good strong words that mean something,\" replied Jo, catching\\nher hat as it took a leap off her head preparatory to flying away\\naltogether.\\n\\n\"Call yourself any names you like, but I am neither a rascal nor a\\nwretch and I don\\'t choose to be called so.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re a blighted being, and decidedly cross today because you can\\'t\\nsit in the lap of luxury all the time.  Poor dear, just wait till I\\nmake my fortune, and you shall revel in carriages and ice cream and\\nhigh-heeled slippers, and posies, and red-headed boys to dance with.\"\\n\\n\"How ridiculous you are, Jo!\"  But Meg laughed at the nonsense and felt\\nbetter in spite of herself.\\n\\n\"Lucky for you I am, for if I put on crushed airs and tried to be\\ndismal, as you do, we should be in a nice state. Thank goodness, I can\\nalways find something funny to keep me up.  Don\\'t croak any more, but\\ncome home jolly, there\\'s a dear.\"\\n\\nJo gave her sister an encouraging pat on the shoulder as they parted\\nfor the day, each going a different way, each hugging her little warm\\nturnover, and each trying to be cheerful in spite of wintry weather,\\nhard work, and the unsatisfied desires of pleasure-loving youth.\\n\\nWhen Mr. March lost his property in trying to help an unfortunate\\nfriend, the two oldest girls begged to be allowed to do something\\ntoward their own support, at least.  Believing that they could not\\nbegin too early to cultivate energy, industry, and independence, their\\nparents consented, and both fell to work with the hearty good will\\nwhich in spite of all obstacles is sure to succeed at last.\\n\\nMargaret found a place as nursery governess and felt rich with her\\nsmall salary.  As she said, she was \\'fond of luxury\\', and her chief\\ntrouble was poverty.  She found it harder to bear than the others\\nbecause she could remember a time when home was beautiful, life full of\\nease and pleasure, and want of any kind unknown.  She tried not to be\\nenvious or discontented, but it was very natural that the young girl\\nshould long for pretty things, gay friends, accomplishments, and a\\nhappy life.  At the Kings\\' she daily saw all she wanted, for the\\nchildren\\'s older sisters were just out, and Meg caught frequent\\nglimpses of dainty ball dresses and bouquets, heard lively gossip about\\ntheaters, concerts, sleighing parties, and merrymakings of all kinds,\\nand saw money lavished on trifles which would have been so precious to\\nher.  Poor Meg seldom complained, but a sense of injustice made her\\nfeel bitter toward everyone sometimes, for she had not yet learned to\\nknow how rich she was in the blessings which alone can make life happy.\\n\\nJo happened to suit Aunt March, who was lame and needed an active\\nperson to wait upon her.  The childless old lady had offered to adopt\\none of the girls when the troubles came, and was much offended because\\nher offer was declined.  Other friends told the Marches that they had\\nlost all chance of being remembered in the rich old lady\\'s will, but\\nthe unworldly Marches only said...\\n\\n\"We can\\'t give up our girls for a dozen fortunes.  Rich or poor, we\\nwill keep together and be happy in one another.\"\\n\\nThe old lady wouldn\\'t speak to them for a time, but happening to meet\\nJo at a friend\\'s, something in her comical face and blunt manners\\nstruck the old lady\\'s fancy, and she proposed to take her for a\\ncompanion.  This did not suit Jo at all, but she accepted the place\\nsince nothing better appeared and, to every one\\'s surprise, got on\\nremarkably well with her irascible relative.  There was an occasional\\ntempest, and once Jo marched home, declaring she couldn\\'t bear it\\nlonger, but Aunt March always cleared up quickly, and sent for her to\\ncome back again with such urgency that she could not refuse, for in her\\nheart she rather liked the peppery old lady.\\n\\nI suspect that the real attraction was a large library of fine books,\\nwhich was left to dust and spiders since Uncle March died.  Jo\\nremembered the kind old gentleman, who used to let her build railroads\\nand bridges with his big dictionaries, tell her stories about queer\\npictures in his Latin books, and buy her cards of gingerbread whenever\\nhe met her in the street.  The dim, dusty room, with the busts staring\\ndown from the tall bookcases, the cozy chairs, the globes, and best of\\nall, the wilderness of books in which she could wander where she liked,\\nmade the library a region of bliss to her.\\n\\nThe moment Aunt March took her nap, or was busy with company, Jo\\nhurried to this quiet place, and curling herself up in the easy chair,\\ndevoured poetry, romance, history, travels, and pictures like a regular\\nbookworm.  But, like all happiness, it did not last long, for as sure\\nas she had just reached the heart of the story, the sweetest verse of a\\nsong, or the most perilous adventure of her traveler, a shrill voice\\ncalled, \"Josy-phine! Josy-phine!\" and she had to leave her paradise to\\nwind yarn, wash the poodle, or read Belsham\\'s Essays by the hour\\ntogether.\\n\\nJo\\'s ambition was to do something very splendid.  What it was, she had\\nno idea as yet, but left it for time to tell her, and meanwhile, found\\nher greatest affliction in the fact that she couldn\\'t read, run, and\\nride as much as she liked.  A quick temper, sharp tongue, and restless\\nspirit were always getting her into scrapes, and her life was a series\\nof ups and downs, which were both comic and pathetic. But the training\\nshe received at Aunt March\\'s was just what she needed, and the thought\\nthat she was doing something to support herself made her happy in spite\\nof the perpetual \"Josy-phine!\"\\n\\nBeth was too bashful to go to school.  It had been tried, but she\\nsuffered so much that it was given up, and she did her lessons at home\\nwith her father.  Even when he went away, and her mother was called to\\ndevote her skill and energy to Soldiers\\' Aid Societies, Beth went\\nfaithfully on by herself and did the best she could.  She was a\\nhousewifely little creature, and helped Hannah keep home neat and\\ncomfortable for the workers, never thinking of any reward but to be\\nloved.  Long, quiet days she spent, not lonely nor idle, for her little\\nworld was peopled with imaginary friends, and she was by nature a busy\\nbee.  There were six dolls to be taken up and dressed every morning,\\nfor Beth was a child still and loved her pets as well as ever.  Not one\\nwhole or handsome one among them, all were outcasts till Beth took them\\nin, for when her sisters outgrew these idols, they passed to her\\nbecause Amy would have nothing old or ugly. Beth cherished them all the\\nmore tenderly for that very reason, and set up a hospital for infirm\\ndolls.  No pins were ever stuck into their cotton vitals, no harsh\\nwords or blows were ever given them, no neglect ever saddened the heart\\nof the most repulsive, but all were fed and clothed, nursed and\\ncaressed with an affection which never failed. One forlorn fragment of\\ndollanity had belonged to Jo and, having led a tempestuous life, was\\nleft a wreck in the rag bag, from which dreary poorhouse it was rescued\\nby Beth and taken to her refuge.  Having no top to its head, she tied\\non a neat little cap, and as both arms and legs were gone, she hid\\nthese deficiencies by folding it in a blanket and devoting her best bed\\nto this chronic invalid.  If anyone had known the care lavished on that\\ndolly, I think it would have touched their hearts, even while they\\nlaughed. She brought it bits of bouquets, she read to it, took it out\\nto breathe fresh air, hidden under her coat, she sang it lullabies and\\nnever went to bed without kissing its dirty face and whispering\\ntenderly, \"I hope you\\'ll have a good night, my poor dear.\"\\n\\nBeth had her troubles as well as the others, and not being an angel but\\na very human little girl, she often \\'wept a little weep\\' as Jo said,\\nbecause she couldn\\'t take music lessons and have a fine piano.  She\\nloved music so dearly, tried so hard to learn, and practiced away so\\npatiently at the jingling old instrument, that it did seem as if\\nsomeone (not to hint Aunt March) ought to help her.  Nobody did,\\nhowever, and nobody saw Beth wipe the tears off the yellow keys, that\\nwouldn\\'t keep in tune, when she was all alone. She sang like a little\\nlark about her work, never was too tired for Marmee and the girls, and\\nday after day said hopefully to herself, \"I know I\\'ll get my music some\\ntime, if I\\'m good.\"\\n\\nThere are many Beths in the world, shy and quiet, sitting in corners\\ntill needed, and living for others so cheerfully that no one sees the\\nsacrifices till the little cricket on the hearth stops chirping, and\\nthe sweet, sunshiny presence vanishes, leaving silence and shadow\\nbehind.\\n\\nIf anybody had asked Amy what the greatest trial of her life was, she\\nwould have answered at once, \"My nose.\"  When she was a baby, Jo had\\naccidently dropped her into the coal hod, and Amy insisted that the\\nfall had ruined her nose forever.  It was not big nor red, like poor\\n\\'Petrea\\'s\\', it was only rather flat, and all the pinching in the world\\ncould not give it an aristocratic point.  No one minded it but herself,\\nand it was doing its best to grow, but Amy felt deeply the want of a\\nGrecian nose, and drew whole sheets of handsome ones to console herself.\\n\\n\"Little Raphael,\" as her sisters called her, had a decided talent for\\ndrawing, and was never so happy as when copying flowers, designing\\nfairies, or illustrating stories with queer specimens of art.  Her\\nteachers complained that instead of doing her sums she covered her\\nslate with animals, the blank pages of her atlas were used to copy maps\\non, and caricatures of the most ludicrous description came fluttering\\nout of all her books at unlucky moments.  She got through her lessons\\nas well as she could, and managed to escape reprimands by being a model\\nof deportment.  She was a great favorite with her mates, being\\ngood-tempered and possessing the happy art of pleasing without effort.\\nHer little airs and graces were much admired, so were her\\naccomplishments, for besides her drawing, she could play twelve tunes,\\ncrochet, and read French without mispronouncing more than two-thirds of\\nthe words.  She had a plaintive way of saying, \"When Papa was rich we\\ndid so-and-so,\" which was very touching, and her long words were\\nconsidered \\'perfectly elegant\\' by the girls.\\n\\nAmy was in a fair way to be spoiled, for everyone petted her, and her\\nsmall vanities and selfishnesses were growing nicely. One thing,\\nhowever, rather quenched the vanities.  She had to wear her cousin\\'s\\nclothes.  Now Florence\\'s mama hadn\\'t a particle of taste, and Amy\\nsuffered deeply at having to wear a red instead of a blue bonnet,\\nunbecoming gowns, and fussy aprons that did not fit.  Everything was\\ngood, well made, and little worn, but Amy\\'s artistic eyes were much\\nafflicted, especially this winter, when her school dress was a dull\\npurple with yellow dots and no trimming.\\n\\n\"My only comfort,\" she said to Meg, with tears in her eyes, \"is that\\nMother doesn\\'t take tucks in my dresses whenever I\\'m naughty, as Maria\\nParks\\'s mother does.  My dear, it\\'s really dreadful, for sometimes she\\nis so bad her frock is up to her knees, and she can\\'t come to school.\\nWhen I think of this _deggerredation_, I feel that I can bear even my\\nflat nose and purple gown with yellow sky-rockets on it.\"\\n\\nMeg was Amy\\'s confidant and monitor, and by some strange attraction of\\nopposites Jo was gentle Beth\\'s.  To Jo alone did the shy child tell her\\nthoughts, and over her big harum-scarum sister Beth unconsciously\\nexercised more influence than anyone in the family.  The two older\\ngirls were a great deal to one another, but each took one of the\\nyounger sisters into her keeping and watched over her in her own way,\\n\\'playing mother\\' they called it, and put their sisters in the places of\\ndiscarded dolls with the maternal instinct of little women.\\n\\n\"Has anybody got anything to tell?  It\\'s been such a dismal day I\\'m\\nreally dying for some amusement,\" said Meg, as they sat sewing together\\nthat evening.\\n\\n\"I had a queer time with Aunt today, and, as I got the best of it, I\\'ll\\ntell you about it,\" began Jo, who dearly loved to tell stories.  \"I was\\nreading that everlasting Belsham, and droning away as I always do, for\\nAunt soon drops off, and then I take out some nice book, and read like\\nfury till she wakes up.  I actually made myself sleepy, and before she\\nbegan to nod, I gave such a gape that she asked me what I meant by\\nopening my mouth wide enough to take the whole book in at once.\"\\n\\n\"I wish I could, and be done with it,\" said I, trying not to be saucy.\\n\\n\"Then she gave me a long lecture on my sins, and told me to sit and\\nthink them over while she just \\'lost\\' herself for a moment. She never\\nfinds herself very soon, so the minute her cap began to bob like a\\ntop-heavy dahlia, I whipped the _Vicar of Wakefield_ out of my pocket,\\nand read away, with one eye on him and one on Aunt. I\\'d just got to\\nwhere they all tumbled into the water when I forgot and laughed out\\nloud.  Aunt woke up and, being more good-natured after her nap, told me\\nto read a bit and show what frivolous work I preferred to the worthy\\nand instructive Belsham. I did my very best, and she liked it, though\\nshe only said...\\n\\n\"\\'I don\\'t understand what it\\'s all about.  Go back and begin it,\\nchild.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Back I went, and made the Primroses as interesting as ever I could.\\nOnce I was wicked enough to stop in a thrilling place, and say meekly,\\n\\'I\\'m afraid it tires you, ma\\'am.  Shan\\'t I stop now?\\'\"\\n\\n\"She caught up her knitting, which had dropped out of her hands, gave\\nme a sharp look through her specs, and said, in her short way, \\'Finish\\nthe chapter, and don\\'t be impertinent, miss\\'.\"\\n\\n\"Did she own she liked it?\" asked Meg.\\n\\n\"Oh, bless you, no!  But she let old Belsham rest, and when I ran back\\nafter my gloves this afternoon, there she was, so hard at the Vicar\\nthat she didn\\'t hear me laugh as I danced a jig in the hall because of\\nthe good time coming.  What a pleasant life she might have if only she\\nchose!  I don\\'t envy her much, in spite of her money, for after all\\nrich people have about as many worries as poor ones, I think,\" added Jo.\\n\\n\"That reminds me,\" said Meg, \"that I\\'ve got something to tell. It isn\\'t\\nfunny, like Jo\\'s story, but I thought about it a good deal as I came\\nhome.  At the Kings\\' today I found everybody in a flurry, and one of\\nthe children said that her oldest brother had done something dreadful,\\nand Papa had sent him away.  I heard Mrs. King crying and Mr. King\\ntalking very loud, and Grace and Ellen turned away their faces when\\nthey passed me, so I shouldn\\'t see how red and swollen their eyes were.\\nI didn\\'t ask any questions, of course, but I felt so sorry for them and\\nwas rather glad I hadn\\'t any wild brothers to do wicked things and\\ndisgrace the family.\"\\n\\n\"I think being disgraced in school is a great deal try_inger_ than\\nanything bad boys can do,\" said Amy, shaking her head, as if her\\nexperience of life had been a deep one.  \"Susie Perkins came to school\\ntoday with a lovely red carnelian ring.  I wanted it dreadfully, and\\nwished I was her with all my might.  Well, she drew a picture of Mr.\\nDavis, with a monstrous nose and a hump, and the words, \\'Young ladies,\\nmy eye is upon you!\\' coming out of his mouth in a balloon thing.  We\\nwere laughing over it when all of a sudden his eye _was_ on us, and he\\nordered Susie to bring up her slate.  She was _parry_lized with fright,\\nbut she went, and oh, what _do_ you think he did?  He took her by the\\near--the ear!  Just fancy how horrid!--and led her to the recitation\\nplatform, and made her stand there half an hour, holding the slate so\\neveryone could see.\"\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t the girls laugh at the picture?\" asked Jo, who relished the\\nscrape.\\n\\n\"Laugh? Not one! They sat still as mice, and Susie cried quarts, I know\\nshe did.  I didn\\'t envy her then, for I felt that millions of carnelian\\nrings wouldn\\'t have made me happy after that. I never, never should\\nhave got over such a agonizing mortification.\" And Amy went on with her\\nwork, in the proud consciousness of virtue and the successful utterance\\nof two long words in a breath.\\n\\n\"I saw something I liked this morning, and I meant to tell it at\\ndinner, but I forgot,\" said Beth, putting Jo\\'s topsy-turvy basket in\\norder as she talked.  \"When I went to get some oysters for Hannah, Mr.\\nLaurence was in the fish shop, but he didn\\'t see me, for I kept behind\\nthe fish barrel, and he was busy with Mr. Cutter the fish-man. A poor\\nwoman came in with a pail and a mop, and asked Mr. Cutter if he would\\nlet her do some scrubbing for a bit of fish, because she hadn\\'t any\\ndinner for her children, and had been disappointed of a day\\'s work.\\nMr. Cutter was in a hurry and said \\'No\\', rather crossly, so she was\\ngoing away, looking hungry and sorry, when Mr. Laurence hooked up a big\\nfish with the crooked end of his cane and held it out to her.  She was\\nso glad and surprised she took it right into her arms, and thanked him\\nover and over.  He told her to \\'go along and cook it\\', and she hurried\\noff, so happy!  Wasn\\'t it good of him?  Oh, she did look so funny,\\nhugging the big, slippery fish, and hoping Mr. Laurence\\'s bed in heaven\\nwould be \\'aisy\\'.\"\\n\\nWhen they had laughed at Beth\\'s story, they asked their mother for one,\\nand after a moments thought, she said soberly, \"As I sat cutting out\\nblue flannel jackets today at the rooms, I felt very anxious about\\nFather, and thought how lonely and helpless we should be, if anything\\nhappened to him.  It was not a wise thing to do, but I kept on worrying\\ntill an old man came in with an order for some clothes.  He sat down\\nnear me, and I began to talk to him, for he looked poor and tired and\\nanxious.\\n\\n\"\\'Have you sons in the army?\\' I asked, for the note he brought was not\\nto me.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am.  I had four, but two were killed, one is a prisoner, and\\nI\\'m going to the other, who is very sick in a Washington hospital.\\' he\\nanswered quietly.\"\\n\\n\"\\'You have done a great deal for your country, sir,\\' I said, feeling\\nrespect now, instead of pity.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Not a mite more than I ought, ma\\'am.  I\\'d go myself, if I was any\\nuse.  As I ain\\'t, I give my boys, and give \\'em free.\\'\"\\n\\n\"He spoke so cheerfully, looked so sincere, and seemed so glad to give\\nhis all, that I was ashamed of myself.  I\\'d given one man and thought\\nit too much, while he gave four without grudging them.  I had all my\\ngirls to comfort me at home, and his last son was waiting, miles away,\\nto say good-by to him, perhaps!  I felt so rich, so happy thinking of\\nmy blessings, that I made him a nice bundle, gave him some money, and\\nthanked him heartily for the lesson he had taught me.\"\\n\\n\"Tell another story, Mother, one with a moral to it, like this. I like\\nto think about them afterward, if they are real and not too preachy,\"\\nsaid Jo, after a minute\\'s silence.\\n\\nMrs. March smiled and began at once, for she had told stories to this\\nlittle audience for many years, and knew how to please them.\\n\\n\"Once upon a time, there were four girls, who had enough to eat and\\ndrink and wear, a good many comforts and pleasures, kind friends and\\nparents who loved them dearly, and yet they were not contented.\" (Here\\nthe listeners stole sly looks at one another, and began to sew\\ndiligently.) \"These girls were anxious to be good and made many\\nexcellent resolutions, but they did not keep them very well, and were\\nconstantly saying, \\'If only we had this,\\' or \\'If we could only do\\nthat,\\' quite forgetting how much they already had, and how many things\\nthey actually could do.  So they asked an old woman what spell they\\ncould use to make them happy, and she said, \\'When you feel\\ndiscontented, think over your blessings, and be grateful.\\'\" (Here Jo\\nlooked up quickly, as if about to speak, but changed her mind, seeing\\nthat the story was not done yet.)\\n\\n\"Being sensible girls, they decided to try her advice, and soon were\\nsurprised to see how well off they were.  One discovered that money\\ncouldn\\'t keep shame and sorrow out of rich people\\'s houses, another\\nthat, though she was poor, she was a great deal happier, with her\\nyouth, health, and good spirits, than a certain fretful, feeble old\\nlady who couldn\\'t enjoy her comforts, a third that, disagreeable as it\\nwas to help get dinner, it was harder still to go begging for it and\\nthe fourth, that even carnelian rings were not so valuable as good\\nbehavior.  So they agreed to stop complaining, to enjoy the blessings\\nalready possessed, and try to deserve them, lest they should be taken\\naway entirely, instead of increased, and I believe they were never\\ndisappointed or sorry that they took the old woman\\'s advice.\"\\n\\n\"Now, Marmee, that is very cunning of you to turn our own stories\\nagainst us, and give us a sermon instead of a romance!\" cried Meg.\\n\\n\"I like that kind of sermon.  It\\'s the sort Father used to tell us,\"\\nsaid Beth thoughtfully, putting the needles straight on Jo\\'s cushion.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t complain near as much as the others do, and I shall be more\\ncareful than ever now, for I\\'ve had warning from Susie\\'s downfall,\"\\nsaid Amy morally.\\n\\n\"We needed that lesson, and we won\\'t forget it.  If we do so, you just\\nsay to us, as old Chloe did in _Uncle Tom_, \\'Tink ob yer marcies,\\nchillen!\\' \\'Tink ob yer marcies!\\'\" added Jo, who could not, for the life\\nof her, help getting a morsel of fun out of the little sermon, though\\nshe took it to heart as much as any of them.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'FIVE\\n\\nBEING NEIGHBORLY\\n\\n\"What in the world are you going to do now, Jo?\" asked Meg one snowy\\nafternoon, as her sister came tramping through the hall, in rubber\\nboots, old sack, and hood, with a broom in one hand and a shovel in the\\nother.\\n\\n\"Going out for exercise,\" answered Jo with a mischievous twinkle in her\\neyes.\\n\\n\"I should think two long walks this morning would have been enough!\\nIt\\'s cold and dull out, and I advise you to stay warm and dry by the\\nfire, as I do,\" said Meg with a shiver.\\n\\n\"Never take advice!  Can\\'t keep still all day, and not being a\\npussycat, I don\\'t like to doze by the fire.  I like adventures, and I\\'m\\ngoing to find some.\"\\n\\nMeg went back to toast her feet and read _Ivanhoe_, and Jo began to dig\\npaths with great energy.  The snow was light, and with her broom she\\nsoon swept a path all round the garden, for Beth to walk in when the\\nsun came out and the invalid dolls needed air.  Now, the garden\\nseparated the Marches\\' house from that of Mr. Laurence.  Both stood in\\na suburb of the city, which was still country-like, with groves and\\nlawns, large gardens, and quiet streets.  A low hedge parted the two\\nestates.  On one side was an old, brown house, looking rather bare and\\nshabby, robbed of the vines that in summer covered its walls and the\\nflowers, which then surrounded it.  On the other side was a stately\\nstone mansion, plainly betokening every sort of comfort and luxury,\\nfrom the big coach house and well-kept grounds to the conservatory and\\nthe glimpses of lovely things one caught between the rich curtains.\\n\\nYet it seemed a lonely, lifeless sort of house, for no children\\nfrolicked on the lawn, no motherly face ever smiled at the windows, and\\nfew people went in and out, except the old gentleman and his grandson.\\n\\nTo Jo\\'s lively fancy, this fine house seemed a kind of enchanted\\npalace, full of splendors and delights which no one enjoyed.  She had\\nlong wanted to behold these hidden glories, and to know the Laurence\\nboy, who looked as if he would like to be known, if he only knew how to\\nbegin.  Since the party, she had been more eager than ever, and had\\nplanned many ways of making friends with him, but he had not been seen\\nlately, and Jo began to think he had gone away, when she one day spied\\na brown face at an upper window, looking wistfully down into their\\ngarden, where Beth and Amy were snow-balling one another.\\n\\n\"That boy is suffering for society and fun,\" she said to herself. \"His\\ngrandpa does not know what\\'s good for him, and keeps him shut up all\\nalone.  He needs a party of jolly boys to play with, or somebody young\\nand lively.  I\\'ve a great mind to go over and tell the old gentleman\\nso!\"\\n\\nThe idea amused Jo, who liked to do daring things and was always\\nscandalizing Meg by her queer performances.  The plan of \\'going over\\'\\nwas not forgotten.  And when the snowy afternoon came, Jo resolved to\\ntry what could be done.  She saw Mr. Lawrence drive off, and then\\nsallied out to dig her way down to the hedge, where she paused and took\\na survey.  All quiet, curtains down at the lower windows, servants out\\nof sight, and nothing human visible but a curly black head leaning on a\\nthin hand at the upper window.\\n\\n\"There he is,\" thought Jo, \"Poor boy!  All alone and sick this dismal\\nday.  It\\'s a shame!  I\\'ll toss up a snowball and make him look out, and\\nthen say a kind word to him.\"\\n\\nUp went a handful of soft snow, and the head turned at once, showing a\\nface which lost its listless look in a minute, as the big eyes\\nbrightened and the mouth began to smile.  Jo nodded and laughed, and\\nflourished her broom as she called out...\\n\\n\"How do you do?  Are you sick?\"\\n\\nLaurie opened the window, and croaked out as hoarsely as a raven...\\n\\n\"Better, thank you.  I\\'ve had a bad cold, and been shut up a week.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry.  What do you amuse yourself with?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing.  It\\'s dull as tombs up here.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you read?\"\\n\\n\"Not much.  They won\\'t let me.\"\\n\\n\"Can\\'t somebody read to you?\"\\n\\n\"Grandpa does sometimes, but my books don\\'t interest him, and I hate to\\nask Brooke all the time.\"\\n\\n\"Have someone come and see you then.\"\\n\\n\"There isn\\'t anyone I\\'d like to see.  Boys make such a row, and my head\\nis weak.\"\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t there some nice girl who\\'d read and amuse you?  Girls are quiet\\nand like to play nurse.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t know any.\"\\n\\n\"You know us,\" began Jo, then laughed and stopped.\\n\\n\"So I do!  Will you come, please?\" cried Laurie.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not quiet and nice, but I\\'ll come, if Mother will let me. I\\'ll go\\nask her.  Shut the window, like a good boy, and wait till I come.\"\\n\\nWith that, Jo shouldered her broom and marched into the house,\\nwondering what they would all say to her.  Laurie was in a flutter of\\nexcitement at the idea of having company, and flew about to get ready,\\nfor as Mrs. March said, he was \\'a little gentleman\\', and did honor to\\nthe coming guest by brushing his curly pate, putting on a fresh color,\\nand trying to tidy up the room, which in spite of half a dozen\\nservants, was anything but neat.  Presently there came a loud ring,\\nthan a decided voice, asking for \\'Mr. Laurie\\', and a surprised-looking\\nservant came running up to announce a young lady.\\n\\n\"All right, show her up, it\\'s Miss Jo,\" said Laurie, going to the door\\nof his little parlor to meet Jo, who appeared, looking rosy and quite\\nat her ease, with a covered dish in one hand and Beth\\'s three kittens\\nin the other.\\n\\n\"Here I am, bag and baggage,\" she said briskly.  \"Mother sent her love,\\nand was glad if I could do anything for you.  Meg wanted me to bring\\nsome of her blanc mange, she makes it very nicely, and Beth thought her\\ncats would be comforting.  I knew you\\'d laugh at them, but I couldn\\'t\\nrefuse, she was so anxious to do something.\"\\n\\nIt so happened that Beth\\'s funny loan was just the thing, for in\\nlaughing over the kits, Laurie forgot his bashfulness, and grew\\nsociable at once.\\n\\n\"That looks too pretty to eat,\" he said, smiling with pleasure, as Jo\\nuncovered the dish, and showed the blanc mange, surrounded by a garland\\nof green leaves, and the scarlet flowers of Amy\\'s pet geranium.\\n\\n\"It isn\\'t anything, only they all felt kindly and wanted to show it.\\nTell the girl to put it away for your tea.  It\\'s so simple you can eat\\nit, and being soft, it will slip down without hurting your sore throat.\\nWhat a cozy room this is!\"\\n\\n\"It might be if it was kept nice, but the maids are lazy, and I don\\'t\\nknow how to make them mind.  It worries me though.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll right it up in two minutes, for it only needs to have the hearth\\nbrushed, so--and the things made straight on the mantelpiece, so--and\\nthe books put here, and the bottles there, and your sofa turned from\\nthe light, and the pillows plumped up a bit.  Now then, you\\'re fixed.\"\\n\\nAnd so he was, for, as she laughed and talked, Jo had whisked things\\ninto place and given quite a different air to the room.  Laurie watched\\nher in respectful silence, and when she beckoned him to his sofa, he\\nsat down with a sigh of satisfaction, saying gratefully...\\n\\n\"How kind you are!  Yes, that\\'s what it wanted.  Now please take the\\nbig chair and let me do something to amuse my company.\"\\n\\n\"No, I came to amuse you.  Shall I read aloud?\" and Jo looked\\naffectionately toward some inviting books near by.\\n\\n\"Thank you!  I\\'ve read all those, and if you don\\'t mind, I\\'d rather\\ntalk,\" answered Laurie.\\n\\n\"Not a bit.  I\\'ll talk all day if you\\'ll only set me going. Beth says I\\nnever know when to stop.\"\\n\\n\"Is Beth the rosy one, who stays at home good deal and sometimes goes\\nout with a little basket?\" asked Laurie with interest.\\n\\n\"Yes, that\\'s Beth.  She\\'s my girl, and a regular good one she is, too.\"\\n\\n\"The pretty one is Meg, and the curly-haired one is Amy, I believe?\"\\n\\n\"How did you find that out?\"\\n\\nLaurie colored up, but answered frankly, \"Why, you see I often hear you\\ncalling to one another, and when I\\'m alone up here, I can\\'t help\\nlooking over at your house, you always seem to be having such good\\ntimes.  I beg your pardon for being so rude, but sometimes you forget\\nto put down the curtain at the window where the flowers are. And when\\nthe lamps are lighted, it\\'s like looking at a picture to see the fire,\\nand you all around the table with your mother.  Her face is right\\nopposite, and it looks so sweet behind the flowers, I can\\'t help\\nwatching it.  I haven\\'t got any mother, you know.\" And Laurie poked the\\nfire to hide a little twitching of the lips that he could not control.\\n\\nThe solitary, hungry look in his eyes went straight to Jo\\'s warm heart.\\nShe had been so simply taught that there was no nonsense in her head,\\nand at fifteen she was as innocent and frank as any child.  Laurie was\\nsick and lonely, and feeling how rich she was in home and happiness,\\nshe gladly tried to share it with him. Her face was very friendly and\\nher sharp voice unusually gentle as she said...\\n\\n\"We\\'ll never draw that curtain any more, and I give you leave to look\\nas much as you like.  I just wish, though, instead of peeping, you\\'d\\ncome over and see us.  Mother is so splendid, she\\'d do you heaps of\\ngood, and Beth would sing to you if I begged her to, and Amy would\\ndance.  Meg and I would make you laugh over our funny stage properties,\\nand we\\'d have jolly times.  Wouldn\\'t your grandpa let you?\"\\n\\n\"I think he would, if your mother asked him.  He\\'s very kind, though he\\ndoes not look so, and he lets me do what I like, pretty much, only he\\'s\\nafraid I might be a bother to strangers,\" began Laurie, brightening\\nmore and more.\\n\\n\"We are not strangers, we are neighbors, and you needn\\'t think you\\'d be\\na bother.  We want to know you, and I\\'ve been trying to do it this ever\\nso long.  We haven\\'t been here a great while, you know, but we have got\\nacquainted with all our neighbors but you.\"\\n\\n\"You see, Grandpa lives among his books, and doesn\\'t mind much what\\nhappens outside.  Mr. Brooke, my tutor, doesn\\'t stay here, you know,\\nand I have no one to go about with me, so I just stop at home and get\\non as I can.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s bad.  You ought to make an effort and go visiting everywhere\\nyou are asked, then you\\'ll have plenty of friends, and pleasant places\\nto go to.  Never mind being bashful.  It won\\'t last long if you keep\\ngoing.\"\\n\\nLaurie turned red again, but wasn\\'t offended at being accused of\\nbashfulness, for there was so much good will in Jo it was impossible\\nnot to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were meant.\\n\\n\"Do you like your school?\" asked the boy, changing the subject, after a\\nlittle pause, during which he stared at the fire and Jo looked about\\nher, well pleased.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t go to school, I\\'m a businessman--girl, I mean.  I go to wait on\\nmy great-aunt, and a dear, cross old soul she is, too,\" answered Jo.\\n\\nLaurie opened his mouth to ask another question, but remembering just\\nin time that it wasn\\'t manners to make too many inquiries into people\\'s\\naffairs, he shut it again, and looked uncomfortable.\\n\\nJo liked his good breeding, and didn\\'t mind having a laugh at Aunt\\nMarch, so she gave him a lively description of the fidgety old lady,\\nher fat poodle, the parrot that talked Spanish, and the library where\\nshe reveled.\\n\\nLaurie enjoyed that immensely, and when she told about the prim old\\ngentleman who came once to woo Aunt March, and in the middle of a fine\\nspeech, how Poll had tweaked his wig off to his great dismay, the boy\\nlay back and laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks, and a maid\\npopped her head in to see what was the matter.\\n\\n\"Oh!  That does me no end of good.  Tell on, please,\" he said, taking\\nhis face out of the sofa cushion, red and shining with merriment.\\n\\nMuch elated with her success, Jo did \\'tell on\\', all about their plays\\nand plans, their hopes and fears for Father, and the most interesting\\nevents of the little world in which the sisters lived.  Then they got\\nto talking about books, and to Jo\\'s delight, she found that Laurie\\nloved them as well as she did, and had read even more than herself.\\n\\n\"If you like them so much, come down and see ours.  Grandfather is out,\\nso you needn\\'t be afraid,\" said Laurie, getting up.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not afraid of anything,\" returned Jo, with a toss of the head.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t believe you are!\" exclaimed the boy, looking at her with much\\nadmiration, though he privately thought she would have good reason to\\nbe a trifle afraid of the old gentleman, if she met him in some of his\\nmoods.\\n\\nThe atmosphere of the whole house being summerlike, Laurie led the way\\nfrom room to room, letting Jo stop to examine whatever struck her\\nfancy.  And so, at last they came to the library, where she clapped her\\nhands and pranced, as she always did when especially delighted.  It was\\nlined with books, and there were pictures and statues, and distracting\\nlittle cabinets full of coins and curiosities, and Sleepy Hollow\\nchairs, and queer tables, and bronzes, and best of all, a great open\\nfireplace with quaint tiles all round it.\\n\\n\"What richness!\" sighed Jo, sinking into the depth of a velour chair\\nand gazing about her with an air of intense satisfaction. \"Theodore\\nLaurence, you ought to be the happiest boy in the world,\" she added\\nimpressively.\\n\\n\"A fellow can\\'t live on books,\" said Laurie, shaking his head as he\\nperched on a table opposite.\\n\\nBefore he could more, a bell rang, and Jo flew up, exclaiming with\\nalarm, \"Mercy me!  It\\'s your grandpa!\"\\n\\n\"Well, what if it is?  You are not afraid of anything, you know,\"\\nreturned the boy, looking wicked.\\n\\n\"I think I am a little bit afraid of him, but I don\\'t know why I should\\nbe.  Marmee said I might come, and I don\\'t think you\\'re any the worse\\nfor it,\" said Jo, composing herself, though she kept her eyes on the\\ndoor.\\n\\n\"I\\'m a great deal better for it, and ever so much obliged. I\\'m only\\nafraid you are very tired of talking to me.  It was so pleasant, I\\ncouldn\\'t bear to stop,\" said Laurie gratefully.\\n\\n\"The doctor to see you, sir,\" and the maid beckoned as she spoke.\\n\\n\"Would you mind if I left you for a minute?  I suppose I must see him,\"\\nsaid Laurie.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t mind me.  I\\'m happy as a cricket here,\" answered Jo.\\n\\nLaurie went away, and his guest amused herself in her own way. She was\\nstanding before a fine portrait of the old gentleman when the door\\nopened again, and without turning, she said decidedly, \"I\\'m sure now\\nthat I shouldn\\'t be afraid of him, for he\\'s got kind eyes, though his\\nmouth is grim, and he looks as if he had a tremendous will of his own.\\nHe isn\\'t as handsome as my grandfather, but I like him.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, ma\\'am,\" said a gruff voice behind her, and there, to her\\ngreat dismay, stood old Mr. Laurence.\\n\\nPoor Jo blushed till she couldn\\'t blush any redder, and her heart began\\nto beat uncomfortably fast as she thought what she had said.  For a\\nminute a wild desire to run away possessed her, but that was cowardly,\\nand the girls would laugh at her, so she resolved to stay and get out\\nof the scrape as she could.  A second look showed her that the living\\neyes, under the bushy eyebrows, were kinder even than the painted ones,\\nand there was a sly twinkle in them, which lessened her fear a good\\ndeal.  The gruff voice was gruffer than ever, as the old gentleman said\\nabruptly, after the dreadful pause, \"So you\\'re not afraid of me, hey?\"\\n\\n\"Not much, sir.\"\\n\\n\"And you don\\'t think me as handsome as your grandfather?\"\\n\\n\"Not quite, sir.\"\\n\\n\"And I\\'ve got a tremendous will, have I?\"\\n\\n\"I only said I thought so.\"\\n\\n\"But you like me in spite of it?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I do, sir.\"\\n\\nThat answer pleased the old gentleman.  He gave a short laugh, shook\\nhands with her, and, putting his finger under her chin, turned up her\\nface, examined it gravely, and let it go, saying with a nod, \"You\\'ve\\ngot your grandfather\\'s spirit, if you haven\\'t his face.  He was a fine\\nman, my dear, but what is better, he was a brave and an honest one, and\\nI was proud to be his friend.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, sir,\" And Jo was quite comfortable after that, for it\\nsuited her exactly.\\n\\n\"What have you been doing to this boy of mine, hey?\" was the next\\nquestion, sharply put.\\n\\n\"Only trying to be neighborly, sir.\"  And Jo told how her visit came\\nabout.\\n\\n\"You think he needs cheering up a bit, do you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, he seems a little lonely, and young folks would do him good\\nperhaps.  We are only girls, but we should be glad to help if we could,\\nfor we don\\'t forget the splendid Christmas present you sent us,\" said\\nJo eagerly.\\n\\n\"Tut, tut, tut!  That was the boy\\'s affair.  How is the poor woman?\"\\n\\n\"Doing nicely, sir.\"  And off went Jo, talking very fast, as she told\\nall about the Hummels, in whom her mother had interested richer friends\\nthan they were.\\n\\n\"Just her father\\'s way of doing good.  I shall come and see your mother\\nsome fine day.  Tell her so.  There\\'s the tea bell, we have it early on\\nthe boy\\'s account.  Come down and go on being neighborly.\"\\n\\n\"If you\\'d like to have me, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Shouldn\\'t ask you, if I didn\\'t.\"  And Mr. Laurence offered her his arm\\nwith old-fashioned courtesy.\\n\\n\"What would Meg say to this?\" thought Jo, as she was marched away,\\nwhile her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself telling the\\nstory at home.\\n\\n\"Hey!  Why, what the dickens has come to the fellow?\" said the old\\ngentleman, as Laurie came running downstairs and brought up with a\\nstart of surprise at the astounding sight of Jo arm in arm with his\\nredoubtable grandfather.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t know you\\'d come, sir,\" he began, as Jo gave him a triumphant\\nlittle glance.\\n\\n\"That\\'s evident, by the way you racket downstairs.  Come to your tea,\\nsir, and behave like a gentleman.\"  And having pulled the boy\\'s hair by\\nway of a caress, Mr. Laurence walked on, while Laurie went through a\\nseries of comic evolutions behind their backs, which nearly produced an\\nexplosion of laughter from Jo.\\n\\nThe old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four cups of tea,\\nbut he watched the young people, who soon chatted away like old\\nfriends, and the change in his grandson did not escape him.  There was\\ncolor, light, and life in the boy\\'s face now, vivacity in his manner,\\nand genuine merriment in his laugh.\\n\\n\"She\\'s right, the lad is lonely.  I\\'ll see what these little girls can\\ndo for him,\" thought Mr. Laurence, as he looked and listened.  He liked\\nJo, for her odd, blunt ways suited him, and she seemed to understand\\nthe boy almost as well as if she had been one herself.\\n\\nIf the Laurences had been what Jo called \\'prim and poky\\', she would not\\nhave got on at all, for such people always made her shy and awkward.\\nBut finding them free and easy, she was so herself, and made a good\\nimpression.  When they rose she proposed to go, but Laurie said he had\\nsomething more to show her, and took her away to the conservatory,\\nwhich had been lighted for her benefit.  It seemed quite fairylike to\\nJo, as she went up and down the walks, enjoying the blooming walls on\\neither side, the soft light, the damp sweet air, and the wonderful\\nvines and trees that hung about her, while her new friend cut the\\nfinest flowers till his hands were full.  Then he tied them up, saying,\\nwith the happy look Jo liked to see, \"Please give these to your mother,\\nand tell her I like the medicine she sent me very much.\"\\n\\nThey found Mr. Laurence standing before the fire in the great drawing\\nroom, but Jo\\'s attention was entirely absorbed by a grand piano, which\\nstood open.\\n\\n\"Do you play?\" she asked, turning to Laurie with a respectful\\nexpression.\\n\\n\"Sometimes,\" he answered modestly.\\n\\n\"Please do now.  I want to hear it, so I can tell Beth.\"\\n\\n\"Won\\'t you first?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t know how.  Too stupid to learn, but I love music dearly.\"\\n\\nSo Laurie played and Jo listened, with her nose luxuriously buried in\\nheliotrope and tea roses.  Her respect and regard for the \\'Laurence\\'\\nboy increased very much, for he played remarkably well and didn\\'t put\\non any airs.  She wished Beth could hear him, but she did not say so,\\nonly praised him till he was quite abashed, and his grandfather came to\\nhis rescue.\\n\\n\"That will do, that will do, young lady.  Too many sugarplums are not\\ngood for him.  His music isn\\'t bad, but I hope he will do as well in\\nmore important things.  Going?  well, I\\'m much obliged to you, and I\\nhope you\\'ll come again.  My respects to your mother. Good night, Doctor\\nJo.\"\\n\\nHe shook hands kindly, but looked as if something did not please him.\\nWhen they got into the hall, Jo asked Laurie if she had said something\\namiss.  He shook his head.\\n\\n\"No, it was me.  He doesn\\'t like to hear me play.\"\\n\\n\"Why not?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll tell you some day.  John is going home with you, as I can\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"No need of that.  I am not a young lady, and it\\'s only a step.  Take\\ncare of yourself, won\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but you will come again, I hope?\"\\n\\n\"If you promise to come and see us after you are well.\"\\n\\n\"I will.\"\\n\\n\"Good night, Laurie!\"\\n\\n\"Good night, Jo, good night!\"\\n\\nWhen all the afternoon\\'s adventures had been told, the family felt\\ninclined to go visiting in a body, for each found something very\\nattractive in the big house on the other side of the hedge. Mrs. March\\nwanted to talk of her father with the old man who had not forgotten\\nhim, Meg longed to walk in the conservatory, Beth sighed for the grand\\npiano, and Amy was eager to see the fine pictures and statues.\\n\\n\"Mother, why didn\\'t Mr. Laurence like to have Laurie play?\" asked Jo,\\nwho was of an inquiring disposition.\\n\\n\"I am not sure, but I think it was because his son, Laurie\\'s father,\\nmarried an Italian lady, a musician, which displeased the old man, who\\nis very proud.  The lady was good and lovely and accomplished, but he\\ndid not like her, and never saw his son after he married.  They both\\ndied when Laurie was a little child, and then his grandfather took him\\nhome.  I fancy the boy, who was born in Italy, is not very strong, and\\nthe old man is afraid of losing him, which makes him so careful.\\nLaurie comes naturally by his love of music, for he is like his mother,\\nand I dare say his grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician.\\nAt any rate, his skill reminds him of the woman he did not like, and so\\nhe \\'glowered\\' as Jo said.\"\\n\\n\"Dear me, how romantic!\" exclaimed Meg.\\n\\n\"How silly!\" said Jo.  \"Let him be a musician if he wants to, and not\\nplague his life out sending him to college, when he hates to go.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners, I\\nsuppose.  Italians are always nice,\" said Meg, who was a little\\nsentimental.\\n\\n\"What do you know about his eyes and his manners?  You never spoke to\\nhim, hardly,\" cried Jo, who was not sentimental.\\n\\n\"I saw him at the party, and what you tell shows that he knows how to\\nbehave.  That was a nice little speech about the medicine Mother sent\\nhim.\"\\n\\n\"He meant the blanc mange, I suppose.\"\\n\\n\"How stupid you are, child!  He meant you, of course.\"\\n\\n\"Did he?\" And Jo opened her eyes as if it had never occurred to her\\nbefore.\\n\\n\"I never saw such a girl!  You don\\'t know a compliment when you get\\nit,\" said Meg, with the air of a young lady who knew all about the\\nmatter.\\n\\n\"I think they are great nonsense, and I\\'ll thank you not to be silly\\nand spoil my fun.  Laurie\\'s a nice boy and I like him, and I won\\'t have\\nany sentimental stuff about compliments and such rubbish.  We\\'ll all be\\ngood to him because he hasn\\'t got any mother, and he may come over and\\nsee us, mayn\\'t he, Marmee?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Jo, your little friend is very welcome, and I hope Meg will\\nremember that children should be children as long as they can.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t call myself a child, and I\\'m not in my teens yet,\" observed\\nAmy.  \"What do you say, Beth?\"\\n\\n\"I was thinking about our \\'_Pilgrim\\'s Progress_\\',\" answered Beth, who\\nhad not heard a word.  \"How we got out of the Slough and through the\\nWicket Gate by resolving to be good, and up the steep hill by trying,\\nand that maybe the house over there, full of splendid things, is going\\nto be our Palace Beautiful.\"\\n\\n\"We have got to get by the lions first,\" said Jo, as if she rather\\nliked the prospect.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'SIX\\n\\nBETH FINDS THE PALACE BEAUTIFUL\\n\\nThe big house did prove a Palace Beautiful, though it took some time\\nfor all to get in, and Beth found it very hard to pass the lions.  Old\\nMr. Laurence was the biggest one, but after he had called, said\\nsomething funny or kind to each one of the girls, and talked over old\\ntimes with their mother, nobody felt much afraid of him, except timid\\nBeth.  The other lion was the fact that they were poor and Laurie rich,\\nfor this made them shy of accepting favors which they could not return.\\nBut, after a while, they found that he considered them the benefactors,\\nand could not do enough to show how grateful he was for Mrs. March\\'s\\nmotherly welcome, their cheerful society, and the comfort he took in\\nthat humble home of theirs.  So they soon forgot their pride and\\ninterchanged kindnesses without stopping to think which was the greater.\\n\\nAll sorts of pleasant things happened about that time, for the new\\nfriendship flourished like grass in spring.  Every one liked Laurie,\\nand he privately informed his tutor that \"the Marches were regularly\\nsplendid girls.\"  With the delightful enthusiasm of youth, they took\\nthe solitary boy into their midst and made much of him, and he found\\nsomething very charming in the innocent companionship of these\\nsimple-hearted girls.  Never having known mother or sisters, he was\\nquick to feel the influences they brought about him, and their busy,\\nlively ways made him ashamed of the indolent life he led. He was tired\\nof books, and found people so interesting now that Mr. Brooke was\\nobliged to make very unsatisfactory reports, for Laurie was always\\nplaying truant and running over to the Marches\\'.\\n\\n\"Never mind, let him take a holiday, and make it up afterward,\" said\\nthe old gentleman.  \"The good lady next door says he is studying too\\nhard and needs young society, amusement, and exercise.  I suspect she\\nis right, and that I\\'ve been coddling the fellow as if I\\'d been his\\ngrandmother.  Let him do what he likes, as long as he is happy. He\\ncan\\'t get into mischief in that little nunnery over there, and Mrs.\\nMarch is doing more for him than we can.\"\\n\\nWhat good times they had, to be sure.  Such plays and tableaux, such\\nsleigh rides and skating frolics, such pleasant evenings in the old\\nparlor, and now and then such gay little parties at the great house.\\nMeg could walk in the conservatory whenever she liked and revel in\\nbouquets, Jo browsed over the new library voraciously, and convulsed\\nthe old gentleman with her criticisms, Amy copied pictures and enjoyed\\nbeauty to her heart\\'s content, and Laurie played \\'lord of the manor\\' in\\nthe most delightful style.\\n\\nBut Beth, though yearning for the grand piano, could not pluck up\\ncourage to go to the \\'Mansion of Bliss\\', as Meg called it.  She went\\nonce with Jo, but the old gentleman, not being aware of her infirmity,\\nstared at her so hard from under his heavy eyebrows, and said \"Hey!\" so\\nloud, that he frightened her so much her \\'feet chattered on the floor\\',\\nshe never told her mother, and she ran away, declaring she would never\\ngo there any more, not even for the dear piano.  No persuasions or\\nenticements could overcome her fear, till, the fact coming to Mr.\\nLaurence\\'s ear in some mysterious way, he set about mending matters.\\nDuring one of the brief calls he made, he artfully led the conversation\\nto music, and talked away about great singers whom he had seen, fine\\norgans he had heard, and told such charming anecdotes that Beth found\\nit impossible to stay in her distant corner, but crept nearer and\\nnearer, as if fascinated.  At the back of his chair she stopped and\\nstood listening, with her great eyes wide open and her cheeks red with\\nexcitement of this unusual performance.  Taking no more notice of her\\nthan if she had been a fly, Mr. Laurence talked on about Laurie\\'s\\nlessons and teachers.  And presently, as if the idea had just occurred\\nto him, he said to Mrs. March...\\n\\n\"The boy neglects his music now, and I\\'m glad of it, for he was getting\\ntoo fond of it.  But the piano suffers for want of use.  Wouldn\\'t some\\nof your girls like to run over, and practice on it now and then, just\\nto keep it in tune, you know, ma\\'am?\"\\n\\nBeth took a step forward, and pressed her hands tightly together to\\nkeep from clapping them, for this was an irresistible temptation, and\\nthe thought of practicing on that splendid instrument quite took her\\nbreath away.  Before Mrs. March could reply, Mr. Laurence went on with\\nan odd little nod and smile...\\n\\n\"They needn\\'t see or speak to anyone, but run in at any time. For I\\'m\\nshut up in my study at the other end of the house, Laurie is out a\\ngreat deal, and the servants are never near the drawing room after nine\\no\\'clock.\"\\n\\nHere he rose, as if going, and Beth made up her mind to speak, for that\\nlast arrangement left nothing to be desired.  \"Please, tell the young\\nladies what I say, and if they don\\'t care to come, why, never mind.\"\\nHere a little hand slipped into his, and Beth looked up at him with a\\nface full of gratitude, as she said, in her earnest yet timid way...\\n\\n\"Oh sir, they do care, very very much!\"\\n\\n\"Are you the musical girl?\" he asked, without any startling \"Hey!\" as\\nhe looked down at her very kindly.\\n\\n\"I\\'m Beth.  I love it dearly, and I\\'ll come, if you are quite sure\\nnobody will hear me, and be disturbed,\" she added, fearing to be rude,\\nand trembling at her own boldness as she spoke.\\n\\n\"Not a soul, my dear.  The house is empty half the day, so come and\\ndrum away as much as you like, and I shall be obliged to you.\"\\n\\n\"How kind you are, sir!\"\\n\\nBeth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he wore, but she was\\nnot frightened now, and gave the hand a grateful squeeze because she\\nhad no words to thank him for the precious gift he had given her. The\\nold gentleman softly stroked the hair off her forehead, and, stooping\\ndown, he kissed her, saying, in a tone few people ever heard...\\n\\n\"I had a little girl once, with eyes like these.  God bless you, my\\ndear!  Good day, madam.\"  And away he went, in a great hurry.\\n\\nBeth had a rapture with her mother, and then rushed up to impart the\\nglorious news to her family of invalids, as the girls were not home.\\nHow blithely she sang that evening, and how they all laughed at her\\nbecause she woke Amy in the night by playing the piano on her face in\\nher sleep.  Next day, having seen both the old and young gentleman out\\nof the house, Beth, after two or three retreats, fairly got in at the\\nside door, and made her way as noiselessly as any mouse to the drawing\\nroom where her idol stood.  Quite by accident, of course, some pretty,\\neasy music lay on the piano, and with trembling fingers and frequent\\nstops to listen and look about, Beth at last touched the great\\ninstrument, and straightway forgot her fear, herself, and everything\\nelse but the unspeakable delight which the music gave her, for it was\\nlike the voice of a beloved friend.\\n\\nShe stayed till Hannah came to take her home to dinner, but she had no\\nappetite, and could only sit and smile upon everyone in a general state\\nof beatitude.\\n\\nAfter that, the little brown hood slipped through the hedge nearly\\nevery day, and the great drawing room was haunted by a tuneful spirit\\nthat came and went unseen.  She never knew that Mr. Laurence opened his\\nstudy door to hear the old-fashioned airs he liked.  She never saw\\nLaurie mount guard in the hall to warn the servants away. She never\\nsuspected that the exercise books and new songs which she found in the\\nrack were put there for her especial benefit, and when he talked to her\\nabout music at home, she only thought how kind he was to tell things\\nthat helped her so much.  So she enjoyed herself heartily, and found,\\nwhat isn\\'t always the case, that her granted wish was all she had\\nhoped.  Perhaps it was because she was so grateful for this blessing\\nthat a greater was given her.  At any rate she deserved both.\\n\\n\"Mother, I\\'m going to work Mr. Laurence a pair of slippers.  He is so\\nkind to me, I must thank him, and I don\\'t know any other way. Can I do\\nit?\" asked Beth, a few weeks after that eventful call of his.\\n\\n\"Yes, dear.  It will please him very much, and be a nice way of\\nthanking him.  The girls will help you about them, and I will pay for\\nthe making up,\" replied Mrs. March, who took peculiar pleasure in\\ngranting Beth\\'s requests because she so seldom asked anything for\\nherself.\\n\\nAfter many serious discussions with Meg and Jo, the pattern was chosen,\\nthe materials bought, and the slippers begun.  A cluster of grave yet\\ncheerful pansies on a deeper purple ground was pronounced very\\nappropriate and pretty, and Beth worked away early and late, with\\noccasional lifts over hard parts.  She was a nimble little needlewoman,\\nand they were finished before anyone got tired of them.  Then she wrote\\na short, simple note, and with Laurie\\'s help, got them smuggled onto\\nthe study table one morning before the old gentleman was up.\\n\\nWhen this excitement was over, Beth waited to see what would happen.\\nAll day passed and a part of the next before any acknowledgement\\narrived, and she was beginning to fear she had offended her crochety\\nfriend.  On the afternoon of the second day, she went out to do an\\nerrand, and give poor Joanna, the invalid doll, her daily exercise.  As\\nshe came up the street, on her return, she saw three, yes, four heads\\npopping in and out of the parlor windows, and the moment they saw her,\\nseveral hands were waved, and several joyful voices screamed...\\n\\n\"Here\\'s a letter from the old gentleman!  Come quick, and read it!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Beth, he\\'s sent you...\" began Amy, gesticulating with unseemly\\nenergy, but she got no further, for Jo quenched her by slamming down\\nthe window.\\n\\nBeth hurried on in a flutter of suspense.  At the door her sisters\\nseized and bore her to the parlor in a triumphal procession, all\\npointing and all saying at once, \"Look there!  Look there!\"  Beth did\\nlook, and turned pale with delight and surprise, for there stood a\\nlittle cabinet piano, with a letter lying on the glossy lid, directed\\nlike a sign board to \"Miss Elizabeth March.\"\\n\\n\"For me?\" gasped Beth, holding onto Jo and feeling as if she should\\ntumble down, it was such an overwhelming thing altogether.\\n\\n\"Yes, all for you, my precious!  Isn\\'t it splendid of him?  Don\\'t you\\nthink he\\'s the dearest old man in the world?  Here\\'s the key in the\\nletter.  We didn\\'t open it, but we are dying to know what he says,\"\\ncried Jo, hugging her sister and offering the note.\\n\\n\"You read it!  I can\\'t, I feel so queer!  Oh, it is too lovely!\" and\\nBeth hid her face in Jo\\'s apron, quite upset by her present.\\n\\nJo opened the paper and began to laugh, for the first words she saw\\nwere...\\n\\n\"Miss March: \"Dear Madam--\"\\n\\n\"How nice it sounds!  I wish someone would write to me so!\" said Amy,\\nwho thought the old-fashioned address very elegant.\\n\\n\"\\'I have had many pairs of slippers in my life, but I never had any\\nthat suited me so well as yours,\\'\" continues Jo.  \"\\'Heart\\'s-ease is my\\nfavorite flower, and these will always remind me of the gentle giver.\\nI like to pay my debts, so I know you will allow \\'the old gentleman\\' to\\nsend you something which once belonged to the little grand daughter he\\nlost.  With hearty thanks and best wishes, I remain \"\\'Your grateful\\nfriend and humble servant, \\'JAMES LAURENCE\\'.\"\\n\\n\"There, Beth, that\\'s an honor to be proud of, I\\'m sure! Laurie told me\\nhow fond Mr. Laurence used to be of the child who died, and how he kept\\nall her little things carefully.  Just think, he\\'s given you her piano.\\nThat comes of having big blue eyes and loving music,\" said Jo, trying\\nto soothe Beth, who trembled and looked more excited than she had ever\\nbeen before.\\n\\n\"See the cunning brackets to hold candles, and the nice green silk,\\npuckered up, with a gold rose in the middle, and the pretty rack and\\nstool, all complete,\" added Meg, opening the instrument and displaying\\nits beauties.\\n\\n\"\\'Your humble servant, James Laurence\\'.  Only think of his writing that\\nto you.  I\\'ll tell the girls.  They\\'ll think it\\'s splendid,\" said Amy,\\nmuch impressed by the note.\\n\\n\"Try it, honey.  Let\\'s hear the sound of the baby pianny,\" said Hannah,\\nwho always took a share in the family joys and sorrows.\\n\\nSo Beth tried it, and everyone pronounced it the most remarkable piano\\never heard.  It had evidently been newly tuned and put in apple-pie\\norder, but, perfect as it was, I think the real charm lay in the\\nhappiest of all happy faces which leaned over it, as Beth lovingly\\ntouched the beautiful black and white keys and pressed the bright\\npedals.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll have to go and thank him,\" said Jo, by way of a joke, for the\\nidea of the child\\'s really going never entered her head.\\n\\n\"Yes, I mean to.  I guess I\\'ll go now, before I get frightened thinking\\nabout it.\" And, to the utter amazement of the assembled family, Beth\\nwalked deliberately down the garden, through the hedge, and in at the\\nLaurences\\' door.\\n\\n\"Well, I wish I may die if it ain\\'t the queerest thing I ever see!  The\\npianny has turned her head!  She\\'d never have gone in her right mind,\"\\ncried Hannah, staring after her, while the girls were rendered quite\\nspeechless by the miracle.\\n\\nThey would have been still more amazed if they had seen what Beth did\\nafterward.  If you will believe me, she went and knocked at the study\\ndoor before she gave herself time to think, and when a gruff voice\\ncalled out, \"come in!\" she did go in, right up to Mr. Laurence, who\\nlooked quite taken aback, and held out her hand, saying, with only a\\nsmall quaver in her voice, \"I came to thank you, sir, for...\" But she\\ndidn\\'t finish, for he looked so friendly that she forgot her speech\\nand, only remembering that he had lost the little girl he loved, she\\nput both arms round his neck and kissed him.\\n\\nIf the roof of the house had suddenly flown off, the old gentleman\\nwouldn\\'t have been more astonished.  But he liked it. Oh, dear, yes, he\\nliked it amazingly!  And was so touched and pleased by that confiding\\nlittle kiss that all his crustiness vanished, and he just set her on\\nhis knee, and laid his wrinkled cheek against her rosy one, feeling as\\nif he had got his own little granddaughter back again.  Beth ceased to\\nfear him from that moment, and sat there talking to him as cozily as if\\nshe had known him all her life, for love casts out fear, and gratitude\\ncan conquer pride.  When she went home, he walked with her to her own\\ngate, shook hands cordially, and touched his hat as he marched back\\nagain, looking very stately and erect, like a handsome, soldierly old\\ngentleman, as he was.\\n\\nWhen the girls saw that performance, Jo began to dance a jig, by way of\\nexpressing her satisfaction, Amy nearly fell out of the window in her\\nsurprise, and Meg exclaimed, with up-lifted hands, \"Well, I do believe\\nthe world is coming to an end.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'SEVEN\\n\\nAMY\\'S VALLEY OF HUMILIATION\\n\\n\"That boy is a perfect cyclops, isn\\'t he?\" said Amy one day, as Laurie\\nclattered by on horseback, with a flourish of his whip as he passed.\\n\\n\"How dare you say so, when he\\'s got both his eyes?  And very handsome\\nones they are, too,\" cried Jo, who resented any slighting remarks about\\nher friend.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t say anything about his eyes, and I don\\'t see why you need\\nfire up when I admire his riding.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, my goodness!  That little goose means a centaur, and she called\\nhim a Cyclops,\" exclaimed Jo, with a burst of laughter.\\n\\n\"You needn\\'t be so rude, it\\'s only a \\'lapse of lingy\\', as Mr. Davis\\nsays,\" retorted Amy, finishing Jo with her Latin.  \"I just wish I had a\\nlittle of the money Laurie spends on that horse,\" she added, as if to\\nherself, yet hoping her sisters would hear.\\n\\n\"Why?\" asked Meg kindly, for Jo had gone off in another laugh at Amy\\'s\\nsecond blunder.\\n\\n\"I need it so much.  I\\'m dreadfully in debt, and it won\\'t be my turn to\\nhave the rag money for a month.\"\\n\\n\"In debt, Amy?  What do you mean?\" And Meg looked sober.\\n\\n\"Why, I owe at least a dozen pickled limes, and I can\\'t pay them, you\\nknow, till I have money, for Marmee forbade my having anything charged\\nat the shop.\"\\n\\n\"Tell me all about it.  Are limes the fashion now?  It used to be\\npricking bits of rubber to make balls.\"  And Meg tried to keep her\\ncountenance, Amy looked so grave and important.\\n\\n\"Why, you see, the girls are always buying them, and unless you want to\\nbe thought mean, you must do it too.  It\\'s nothing but limes now, for\\neveryone is sucking them in their desks in schooltime, and trading them\\noff for pencils, bead rings, paper dolls, or something else, at recess.\\nIf one girl likes another, she gives her a lime.  If she\\'s mad with\\nher, she eats one before her face, and doesn\\'t offer even a suck.  They\\ntreat by turns, and I\\'ve had ever so many but haven\\'t returned them,\\nand I ought for they are debts of honor, you know.\"\\n\\n\"How much will pay them off and restore your credit?\" asked Meg, taking\\nout her purse.\\n\\n\"A quarter would more than do it, and leave a few cents over for a\\ntreat for you.  Don\\'t you like limes?\"\\n\\n\"Not much.  You may have my share.  Here\\'s the money.  Make it last as\\nlong as you can, for it isn\\'t very plenty, you know.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, thank you!  It must be so nice to have pocket money!  I\\'ll have a\\ngrand feast, for I haven\\'t tasted a lime this week.  I felt delicate\\nabout taking any, as I couldn\\'t return them, and I\\'m actually suffering\\nfor one.\"\\n\\nNext day Amy was rather late at school, but could not resist the\\ntemptation of displaying, with pardonable pride, a moist brown-paper\\nparcel, before she consigned it to the inmost recesses of her desk.\\nDuring the next few minutes the rumor that Amy March had got\\ntwenty-four delicious limes (she ate one on the way) and was going to\\ntreat circulated through her \\'set\\', and the attentions of her friends\\nbecame quite overwhelming.  Katy Brown invited her to her next party on\\nthe spot.  Mary Kingsley insisted on lending her her watch till recess,\\nand Jenny Snow, a satirical young lady, who had basely twitted Amy upon\\nher limeless state, promptly buried the hatchet and offered to furnish\\nanswers to certain appalling sums.  But Amy had not forgotten Miss\\nSnow\\'s cutting remarks about \\'some persons whose noses were not too\\nflat to smell other people\\'s limes, and stuck-up people who were not\\ntoo proud to ask for them\\', and she instantly crushed \\'that Snow\\ngirl\\'s\\' hopes by the withering telegram, \"You needn\\'t be so polite all\\nof a sudden, for you won\\'t get any.\"\\n\\nA distinguished personage happened to visit the school that morning,\\nand Amy\\'s beautifully drawn maps received praise, which honor to her\\nfoe rankled in the soul of Miss Snow, and caused Miss March to assume\\nthe airs of a studious young peacock.  But, alas, alas!  Pride goes\\nbefore a fall, and the revengeful Snow turned the tables with\\ndisastrous success.  No sooner had the guest paid the usual stale\\ncompliments and bowed himself out, than Jenny, under pretense of asking\\nan important question, informed Mr. Davis, the teacher, that Amy March\\nhad pickled limes in her desk.\\n\\nNow Mr. Davis had declared limes a contraband article, and solemnly\\nvowed to publicly ferrule the first person who was found breaking the\\nlaw.  This much-enduring man had succeeded in banishing chewing gum\\nafter a long and stormy war, had made a bonfire of the confiscated\\nnovels and newspapers, had suppressed a private post office, had\\nforbidden distortions of the face, nicknames, and caricatures, and done\\nall that one man could do to keep half a hundred rebellious girls in\\norder.  Boys are trying enough to human patience, goodness knows, but\\ngirls are infinitely more so, especially to nervous gentlemen with\\ntyrannical tempers and no more talent for teaching than Dr. Blimber.\\nMr. Davis knew any quantity of Greek, Latin, algebra, and ologies of\\nall sorts so he was called a fine teacher, and manners, morals,\\nfeelings, and examples were not considered of any particular\\nimportance.  It was a most unfortunate moment for denouncing Amy, and\\nJenny knew it.  Mr. Davis had evidently taken his coffee too strong\\nthat morning, there was an east wind, which always affected his\\nneuralgia, and his pupils had not done him the credit which he felt he\\ndeserved.  Therefore, to use the expressive, if not elegant, language\\nof a schoolgirl, \"He was as nervous as a witch and as cross as a bear\".\\nThe word \\'limes\\' was like fire to powder, his yellow face flushed, and\\nhe rapped on his desk with an energy which made Jenny skip to her seat\\nwith unusual rapidity.\\n\\n\"Young ladies, attention, if you please!\"\\n\\nAt the stern order the buzz ceased, and fifty pairs of blue, black,\\ngray, and brown eyes were obediently fixed upon his awful countenance.\\n\\n\"Miss March, come to the desk.\"\\n\\nAmy rose to comply with outward composure, but a secret fear oppressed\\nher, for the limes weighed upon her conscience.\\n\\n\"Bring with you the limes you have in your desk,\" was the unexpected\\ncommand which arrested her before she got out of her seat.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t take all.\" whispered her neighbor, a young lady of great\\npresence of mind.\\n\\nAmy hastily shook out half a dozen and laid the rest down before Mr.\\nDavis, feeling that any man possessing a human heart would relent when\\nthat delicious perfume met his nose.  Unfortunately, Mr. Davis\\nparticularly detested the odor of the fashionable pickle, and disgust\\nadded to his wrath.\\n\\n\"Is that all?\"\\n\\n\"Not quite,\" stammered Amy.\\n\\n\"Bring the rest immediately.\"\\n\\nWith a despairing glance at her set, she obeyed.\\n\\n\"You are sure there are no more?\"\\n\\n\"I never lie, sir.\"\\n\\n\"So I see.  Now take these disgusting things two by two, and throw them\\nout of the window.\"\\n\\nThere was a simultaneous sigh, which created quite a little gust, as\\nthe last hope fled, and the treat was ravished from their longing lips.\\nScarlet with shame and anger, Amy went to and fro six dreadful times,\\nand as each doomed couple, looking oh, so plump and juicy, fell from\\nher reluctant hands, a shout from the street completed the anguish of\\nthe girls, for it told them that their feast was being exulted over by\\nthe little Irish children, who were their sworn foes.  This--this was\\ntoo much.  All flashed indignant or appealing glances at the inexorable\\nDavis, and one passionate lime lover burst into tears.\\n\\nAs Amy returned from her last trip, Mr. Davis gave a portentous \"Hem!\"\\nand said, in his most impressive manner...\\n\\n\"Young ladies, you remember what I said to you a week ago.  I am sorry\\nthis has happened, but I never allow my rules to be infringed, and I\\nnever break my word.  Miss March, hold out your hand.\"\\n\\nAmy started, and put both hands behind her, turning on him an imploring\\nlook which pleaded for her better than the words she could not utter.\\nShe was rather a favorite with \\'old Davis\\', as, of course, he was\\ncalled, and it\\'s my private belief that he would have broken his word\\nif the indignation of one irrepressible young lady had not found vent\\nin a hiss.  That hiss, faint as it was, irritated the irascible\\ngentleman, and sealed the culprit\\'s fate.\\n\\n\"Your hand, Miss March!\" was the only answer her mute appeal received,\\nand too proud to cry or beseech, Amy set her teeth, threw back her head\\ndefiantly, and bore without flinching several tingling blows on her\\nlittle palm.  They were neither many nor heavy, but that made no\\ndifference to her.  For the first time in her life she had been struck,\\nand the disgrace, in her eyes, was as deep as if he had knocked her\\ndown.\\n\\n\"You will now stand on the platform till recess,\" said Mr. Davis,\\nresolved to do the thing thoroughly, since he had begun.\\n\\nThat was dreadful.  It would have been bad enough to go to her seat,\\nand see the pitying faces of her friends, or the satisfied ones of her\\nfew enemies, but to face the whole school, with that shame fresh upon\\nher, seemed impossible, and for a second she felt as if she could only\\ndrop down where she stood, and break her heart with crying.  A bitter\\nsense of wrong and the thought of Jenny Snow helped her to bear it,\\nand, taking the ignominious place, she fixed her eyes on the stove\\nfunnel above what now seemed a sea of faces, and stood there, so\\nmotionless and white that the girls found it hard to study with that\\npathetic figure before them.\\n\\nDuring the fifteen minutes that followed, the proud and sensitive\\nlittle girl suffered a shame and pain which she never forgot.  To\\nothers it might seem a ludicrous or trivial affair, but to her it was a\\nhard experience, for during the twelve years of her life she had been\\ngoverned by love alone, and a blow of that sort had never touched her\\nbefore.  The smart of her hand and the ache of her heart were forgotten\\nin the sting of the thought, \"I shall have to tell at home, and they\\nwill be so disappointed in me!\"\\n\\nThe fifteen minutes seemed an hour, but they came to an end at last,\\nand the word \\'Recess!\\' had never seemed so welcome to her before.\\n\\n\"You can go, Miss March,\" said Mr. Davis, looking, as he felt,\\nuncomfortable.\\n\\nHe did not soon forget the reproachful glance Amy gave him, as she\\nwent, without a word to anyone, straight into the anteroom, snatched\\nher things, and left the place \"forever,\" as she passionately declared\\nto herself.  She was in a sad state when she got home, and when the\\nolder girls arrived, some time later, an indignation meeting was held\\nat once.  Mrs. March did not say much but looked disturbed, and\\ncomforted her afflicted little daughter in her tenderest manner. Meg\\nbathed the insulted hand with glycerine and tears, Beth felt that even\\nher beloved kittens would fail as a balm for griefs like this, Jo\\nwrathfully proposed that Mr. Davis be arrested without delay, and\\nHannah shook her fist at the \\'villain\\' and pounded potatoes for dinner\\nas if she had him under her pestle.\\n\\nNo notice was taken of Amy\\'s flight, except by her mates, but the\\nsharp-eyed demoiselles discovered that Mr. Davis was quite benignant in\\nthe afternoon, also unusually nervous.  Just before school closed, Jo\\nappeared, wearing a grim expression as she stalked up to the desk, and\\ndelivered a letter from her mother, then collected Amy\\'s property, and\\ndeparted, carefully scraping the mud from her boots on the door mat, as\\nif she shook the dust of the place off her feet.\\n\\n\"Yes, you can have a vacation from school, but I want you to study a\\nlittle every day with Beth,\" said Mrs. March that evening. \"I don\\'t\\napprove of corporal punishment, especially for girls.  I dislike Mr.\\nDavis\\'s manner of teaching and don\\'t think the girls you associate with\\nare doing you any good, so I shall ask your father\\'s advice before I\\nsend you anywhere else.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s good!  I wish all the girls would leave, and spoil his old\\nschool.  It\\'s perfectly maddening to think of those lovely limes,\"\\nsighed Amy, with the air of a martyr.\\n\\n\"I am not sorry you lost them, for you broke the rules, and deserved\\nsome punishment for disobedience,\" was the severe reply, which rather\\ndisappointed the young lady, who expected nothing but sympathy.\\n\\n\"Do you mean you are glad I was disgraced before the whole school?\"\\ncried Amy.\\n\\n\"I should not have chosen that way of mending a fault,\" replied her\\nmother, \"but I\\'m not sure that it won\\'t do you more good than a bolder\\nmethod.  You are getting to be rather conceited, my dear, and it is\\nquite time you set about correcting it.  You have a good many little\\ngifts and virtues, but there is no need of parading them, for conceit\\nspoils the finest genius.  There is not much danger that real talent or\\ngoodness will be overlooked long, even if it is, the consciousness of\\npossessing and using it well should satisfy one, and the great charm of\\nall power is modesty.\"\\n\\n\"So it is!\" cried Laurie, who was playing chess in a corner with Jo.\\n\"I knew a girl once, who had a really remarkable talent for music, and\\nshe didn\\'t know it, never guessed what sweet little things she composed\\nwhen she was alone, and wouldn\\'t have believed it if anyone had told\\nher.\"\\n\\n\"I wish I\\'d known that nice girl.  Maybe she would have helped me, I\\'m\\nso stupid,\" said Beth, who stood beside him, listening eagerly.\\n\\n\"You do know her, and she helps you better than anyone else could,\"\\nanswered Laurie, looking at her with such mischievous meaning in his\\nmerry black eyes that Beth suddenly turned very red, and hid her face\\nin the sofa cushion, quite overcome by such an unexpected discovery.\\n\\nJo let Laurie win the game to pay for that praise of her Beth, who\\ncould not be prevailed upon to play for them after her compliment. So\\nLaurie did his best, and sang delightfully, being in a particularly\\nlively humor, for to the Marches he seldom showed the moody side of his\\ncharacter.  When he was gone, Amy, who had been pensive all evening,\\nsaid suddenly, as if busy over some new idea, \"Is Laurie an\\naccomplished boy?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, he has had an excellent education, and has much talent. He will\\nmake a fine man, if not spoiled by petting,\" replied her mother.\\n\\n\"And he isn\\'t conceited, is he?\" asked Amy.\\n\\n\"Not in the least.  That is why he is so charming and we all like him\\nso much.\"\\n\\n\"I see.  It\\'s nice to have accomplishments and be elegant, but not to\\nshow off or get perked up,\" said Amy thoughtfully.\\n\\n\"These things are always seen and felt in a person\\'s manner and\\nconversations, if modestly used, but it is not necessary to display\\nthem,\" said Mrs. March.\\n\\n\"Any more than it\\'s proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns and\\nribbons at once, that folks may know you\\'ve got them,\" added Jo, and\\nthe lecture ended in a laugh.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'EIGHT\\n\\nJO MEETS APOLLYON\\n\\n\"Girls, where are you going?\" asked Amy, coming into their room one\\nSaturday afternoon, and finding them getting ready to go out with an\\nair of secrecy which excited her curiosity.\\n\\n\"Never mind.  Little girls shouldn\\'t ask questions,\" returned Jo\\nsharply.\\n\\nNow if there is anything mortifying to our feelings when we are young,\\nit is to be told that, and to be bidden to \"run away, dear\" is still\\nmore trying to us.  Amy bridled up at this insult, and determined to\\nfind out the secret, if she teased for an hour. Turning to Meg, who\\nnever refused her anything very long, she said coaxingly, \"Do tell me!\\nI should think you might let me go, too, for Beth is fussing over her\\npiano, and I haven\\'t got anything to do, and am so lonely.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t, dear, because you aren\\'t invited,\" began Meg, but Jo broke in\\nimpatiently, \"Now, Meg, be quiet or you will spoil it all.  You can\\'t\\ngo, Amy, so don\\'t be a baby and whine about it.\"\\n\\n\"You are going somewhere with Laurie, I know you are.  You were\\nwhispering and laughing together on the sofa last night, and you\\nstopped when I came in.  Aren\\'t you going with him?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, we are.  Now do be still, and stop bothering.\"\\n\\nAmy held her tongue, but used her eyes, and saw Meg slip a fan into her\\npocket.\\n\\n\"I know!  I know!  You\\'re going to the theater to see the _Seven\\nCastles!_\" she cried, adding resolutely, \"and I shall go, for Mother\\nsaid I might see it, and I\\'ve got my rag money, and it was mean not to\\ntell me in time.\"\\n\\n\"Just listen to me a minute, and be a good child,\" said Meg soothingly.\\n\"Mother doesn\\'t wish you to go this week, because your eyes are not\\nwell enough yet to bear the light of this fairy piece.  Next week you\\ncan go with Beth and Hannah, and have a nice time.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t like that half as well as going with you and Laurie. Please\\nlet me.  I\\'ve been sick with this cold so long, and shut up, I\\'m dying\\nfor some fun.  Do, Meg!  I\\'ll be ever so good,\" pleaded Amy, looking as\\npathetic as she could.\\n\\n\"Suppose we take her.  I don\\'t believe Mother would mind, if we bundle\\nher up well,\" began Meg.\\n\\n\"If she goes I shan\\'t, and if I don\\'t, Laurie won\\'t like it, and it\\nwill be very rude, after he invited only us, to go and drag in Amy.  I\\nshould think she\\'d hate to poke herself where she isn\\'t wanted,\" said\\nJo crossly, for she disliked the trouble of overseeing a fidgety child\\nwhen she wanted to enjoy herself.\\n\\nHer tone and manner angered Amy, who began to put her boots on, saying,\\nin her most aggravating way, \"I shall go.  Meg says I may, and if I pay\\nfor myself, Laurie hasn\\'t anything to do with it.\"\\n\\n\"You can\\'t sit with us, for our seats are reserved, and you mustn\\'t sit\\nalone, so Laurie will give you his place, and that will spoil our\\npleasure.  Or he\\'ll get another seat for you, and that isn\\'t proper\\nwhen you weren\\'t asked.  You shan\\'t stir a step, so you may just stay\\nwhere you are,\" scolded Jo, crosser than ever, having just pricked her\\nfinger in her hurry.\\n\\nSitting on the floor with one boot on, Amy began to cry and Meg to\\nreason with her, when Laurie called from below, and the two girls\\nhurried down, leaving their sister wailing.  For now and then she\\nforgot her grown-up ways and acted like a spoiled child.  Just as the\\nparty was setting out, Amy called over the banisters in a threatening\\ntone, \"You\\'ll be sorry for this, Jo March, see if you ain\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"Fiddlesticks!\" returned Jo, slamming the door.\\n\\nThey had a charming time, for _The Seven Castles Of The Diamond Lake_\\nwas as brilliant and wonderful as heart could wish. But in spite of the\\ncomical red imps, sparkling elves, and the gorgeous princes and\\nprincesses, Jo\\'s pleasure had a drop of bitterness in it.  The fairy\\nqueen\\'s yellow curls reminded her of Amy, and between the acts she\\namused herself with wondering what her sister would do to make her\\n\\'sorry for it\\'.  She and Amy had had many lively skirmishes in the\\ncourse of their lives, for both had quick tempers and were apt to be\\nviolent when fairly roused.  Amy teased Jo, and Jo irritated Amy, and\\nsemioccasional explosions occurred, of which both were much ashamed\\nafterward. Although the oldest, Jo had the least self-control, and had\\nhard times trying to curb the fiery spirit which was continually\\ngetting her into trouble.  Her anger never lasted long, and having\\nhumbly confessed her fault, she sincerely repented and tried to do\\nbetter. Her sisters used to say that they rather liked to get Jo into a\\nfury because she was such an angel afterward.  Poor Jo tried\\ndesperately to be good, but her bosom enemy was always ready to flame\\nup and defeat her, and it took years of patient effort to subdue it.\\n\\nWhen they got home, they found Amy reading in the parlor. She assumed\\nan injured air as they came in, never lifted her eyes from her book, or\\nasked a single question.  Perhaps curiosity might have conquered\\nresentment, if Beth had not been there to inquire and receive a glowing\\ndescription of the play.  On going up to put away her best hat, Jo\\'s\\nfirst look was toward the bureau, for in their last quarrel Amy had\\nsoothed her feelings by turning Jo\\'s top drawer upside down on the\\nfloor.  Everything was in its place, however, and after a hasty glance\\ninto her various closets, bags, and boxes, Jo decided that Amy had\\nforgiven and forgotten her wrongs.\\n\\nThere Jo was mistaken, for next day she made a discovery which produced\\na tempest.  Meg, Beth, and Amy were sitting together, late in the\\nafternoon, when Jo burst into the room, looking excited and demanding\\nbreathlessly, \"Has anyone taken my book?\"\\n\\nMeg and Beth said, \"No.\" at once, and looked surprised.  Amy poked the\\nfire and said nothing.  Jo saw her color rise and was down upon her in\\na minute.\\n\\n\"Amy, you\\'ve got it!\"\\n\\n\"No, I haven\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"You know where it is, then!\"\\n\\n\"No, I don\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s a fib!\" cried Jo, taking her by the shoulders, and looking\\nfierce enough to frighten a much braver child than Amy.\\n\\n\"It isn\\'t.  I haven\\'t got it, don\\'t know where it is now, and don\\'t\\ncare.\"\\n\\n\"You know something about it, and you\\'d better tell at once, or I\\'ll\\nmake you.\"  And Jo gave her a slight shake.\\n\\n\"Scold as much as you like, you\\'ll never see your silly old book\\nagain,\" cried Amy, getting excited in her turn.\\n\\n\"Why not?\"\\n\\n\"I burned it up.\"\\n\\n\"What!  My little book I was so fond of, and worked over, and meant to\\nfinish before Father got home?  Have you really burned it?\" said Jo,\\nturning very pale, while her eyes kindled and her hands clutched Amy\\nnervously.\\n\\n\"Yes, I did!  I told you I\\'d make you pay for being so cross yesterday,\\nand I have, so...\"\\n\\nAmy got no farther, for Jo\\'s hot temper mastered her, and she shook Amy\\ntill her teeth chattered in her head, crying in a passion of grief and\\nanger...\\n\\n\"You wicked, wicked girl!  I never can write it again, and I\\'ll never\\nforgive you as long as I live.\"\\n\\nMeg flew to rescue Amy, and Beth to pacify Jo, but Jo was quite beside\\nherself, and with a parting box on her sister\\'s ear, she rushed out of\\nthe room up to the old sofa in the garret, and finished her fight alone.\\n\\nThe storm cleared up below, for Mrs. March came home, and, having heard\\nthe story, soon brought Amy to a sense of the wrong she had done her\\nsister.  Jo\\'s book was the pride of her heart, and was regarded by her\\nfamily as a literary sprout of great promise.  It was only half a dozen\\nlittle fairy tales, but Jo had worked over them patiently, putting her\\nwhole heart into her work, hoping to make something good enough to\\nprint.  She had just copied them with great care, and had destroyed the\\nold manuscript, so that Amy\\'s bonfire had consumed the loving work of\\nseveral years.  It seemed a small loss to others, but to Jo it was a\\ndreadful calamity, and she felt that it never could be made up to her.\\nBeth mourned as for a departed kitten, and Meg refused to defend her\\npet.  Mrs. March looked grave and grieved, and Amy felt that no one\\nwould love her till she had asked pardon for the act which she now\\nregretted more than any of them.\\n\\nWhen the tea bell rang, Jo appeared, looking so grim and unapproachable\\nthat it took all Amy\\'s courage to say meekly...\\n\\n\"Please forgive me, Jo.  I\\'m very, very sorry.\"\\n\\n\"I never shall forgive you,\" was Jo\\'s stern answer, and from that\\nmoment she ignored Amy entirely.\\n\\nNo one spoke of the great trouble, not even Mrs. March, for all had\\nlearned by experience that when Jo was in that mood words were wasted,\\nand the wisest course was to wait till some little accident, or her own\\ngenerous nature, softened Jo\\'s resentment and healed the breach.  It\\nwas not a happy evening, for though they sewed as usual, while their\\nmother read aloud from Bremer, Scott, or Edgeworth, something was\\nwanting, and the sweet home peace was disturbed.  They felt this most\\nwhen singing time came, for Beth could only play, Jo stood dumb as a\\nstone, and Amy broke down, so Meg and Mother sang alone.  But in spite\\nof their efforts to be as cheery as larks, the flutelike voices did not\\nseem to chord as well as usual, and all felt out of tune.\\n\\nAs Jo received her good-night kiss, Mrs. March whispered gently, \"My\\ndear, don\\'t let the sun go down upon your anger.  Forgive each other,\\nhelp each other, and begin again tomorrow.\"\\n\\nJo wanted to lay her head down on that motherly bosom, and cry her\\ngrief and anger all away, but tears were an unmanly weakness, and she\\nfelt so deeply injured that she really couldn\\'t quite forgive yet.  So\\nshe winked hard, shook her head, and said gruffly because Amy was\\nlistening, \"It was an abominable thing, and she doesn\\'t deserve to be\\nforgiven.\"\\n\\nWith that she marched off to bed, and there was no merry or\\nconfidential gossip that night.\\n\\nAmy was much offended that her overtures of peace had been repulsed,\\nand began to wish she had not humbled herself, to feel more injured\\nthan ever, and to plume herself on her superior virtue in a way which\\nwas particularly exasperating.  Jo still looked like a thunder cloud,\\nand nothing went well all day.  It was bitter cold in the morning, she\\ndropped her precious turnover in the gutter, Aunt March had an attack\\nof the fidgets, Meg was sensitive, Beth would look grieved and wistful\\nwhen she got home, and Amy kept making remarks about people who were\\nalways talking about being good and yet wouldn\\'t even try when other\\npeople set them a virtuous example.\\n\\n\"Everybody is so hateful, I\\'ll ask Laurie to go skating.  He is always\\nkind and jolly, and will put me to rights, I know,\" said Jo to herself,\\nand off she went.\\n\\nAmy heard the clash of skates, and looked out with an impatient\\nexclamation.\\n\\n\"There!  She promised I should go next time, for this is the last ice\\nwe shall have.  But it\\'s no use to ask such a crosspatch to take me.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t say that.  You were very naughty, and it is hard to forgive the\\nloss of her precious little book, but I think she might do it now, and\\nI guess she will, if you try her at the right minute,\" said Meg.  \"Go\\nafter them.  Don\\'t say anything till Jo has got good-natured with\\nLaurie, than take a quiet minute and just kiss her, or do some kind\\nthing, and I\\'m sure she\\'ll be friends again with all her heart.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll try,\" said Amy, for the advice suited her, and after a flurry to\\nget ready, she ran after the friends, who were just disappearing over\\nthe hill.\\n\\nIt was not far to the river, but both were ready before Amy reached\\nthem.  Jo saw her coming, and turned her back.  Laurie did not see, for\\nhe was carefully skating along the shore, sounding the ice, for a warm\\nspell had preceded the cold snap.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll go on to the first bend, and see if it\\'s all right before we\\nbegin to race,\" Amy heard him say, as he shot away, looking like a\\nyoung Russian in his fur-trimmed coat and cap.\\n\\nJo heard Amy panting after her run, stamping her feet and blowing on\\nher fingers as she tried to put her skates on, but Jo never turned and\\nwent slowly zigzagging down the river, taking a bitter, unhappy sort of\\nsatisfaction in her sister\\'s troubles. She had cherished her anger till\\nit grew strong and took possession of her, as evil thoughts and\\nfeelings always do unless cast out at once.  As Laurie turned the bend,\\nhe shouted back...\\n\\n\"Keep near the shore.  It isn\\'t safe in the middle.\" Jo heard, but Amy\\nwas struggling to her feet and did not catch a word.  Jo glanced over\\nher shoulder, and the little demon she was harboring said in her ear...\\n\\n\"No matter whether she heard or not, let her take care of herself.\"\\n\\nLaurie had vanished round the bend, Jo was just at the turn, and Amy,\\nfar behind, striking out toward the smoother ice in the middle of the\\nriver.  For a minute Jo stood still with a strange feeling in her\\nheart, then she resolved to go on, but something held and turned her\\nround, just in time to see Amy throw up her hands and go down, with a\\nsudden crash of rotten ice, the splash of water, and a cry that made\\nJo\\'s heart stand still with fear.  She tried to call Laurie, but her\\nvoice was gone.  She tried to rush forward, but her feet seemed to have\\nno strength in them, and for a second, she could only stand motionless,\\nstaring with a terror-stricken face at the little blue hood above the\\nblack water. Something rushed swiftly by her, and Laurie\\'s voice cried\\nout...\\n\\n\"Bring a rail.  Quick, quick!\"\\n\\nHow she did it, she never knew, but for the next few minutes she worked\\nas if possessed, blindly obeying Laurie, who was quite self-possessed,\\nand lying flat, held Amy up by his arm and hockey stick till Jo dragged\\na rail from the fence, and together they got the child out, more\\nfrightened than hurt.\\n\\n\"Now then, we must walk her home as fast as we can.  Pile our things on\\nher, while I get off these confounded skates,\" cried Laurie, wrapping\\nhis coat round Amy, and tugging away at the straps which never seemed\\nso intricate before.\\n\\nShivering, dripping, and crying, they got Amy home, and after an\\nexciting time of it, she fell asleep, rolled in blankets before a hot\\nfire.  During the bustle Jo had scarcely spoken but flown about,\\nlooking pale and wild, with her things half off, her dress torn, and\\nher hands cut and bruised by ice and rails and refractory buckles. When\\nAmy was comfortably asleep, the house quiet, and Mrs. March sitting by\\nthe bed, she called Jo to her and began to bind up the hurt hands.\\n\\n\"Are you sure she is safe?\" whispered Jo, looking remorsefully at the\\ngolden head, which might have been swept away from her sight forever\\nunder the treacherous ice.\\n\\n\"Quite safe, dear.  She is not hurt, and won\\'t even take cold, I think,\\nyou were so sensible in covering and getting her home quickly,\" replied\\nher mother cheerfully.\\n\\n\"Laurie did it all.  I only let her go.  Mother, if she should die, it\\nwould be my fault.\"  And Jo dropped down beside the bed in a passion of\\npenitent tears, telling all that had happened, bitterly condemning her\\nhardness of heart, and sobbing out her gratitude for being spared the\\nheavy punishment which might have come upon her.\\n\\n\"It\\'s my dreadful temper!  I try to cure it, I think I have, and then\\nit breaks out worse than ever.  Oh, Mother, what shall I do?  What\\nshall I do?\" cried poor Jo, in despair.\\n\\n\"Watch and pray, dear, never get tired of trying, and never think it is\\nimpossible to conquer your fault,\" said Mrs. March, drawing the blowzy\\nhead to her shoulder and kissing the wet cheek so tenderly that Jo\\ncried even harder.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t know, you can\\'t guess how bad it is!  It seems as if I could\\ndo anything when I\\'m in a passion.  I get so savage, I could hurt\\nanyone and enjoy it.  I\\'m afraid I shall do something dreadful some\\nday, and spoil my life, and make everybody hate me. Oh, Mother, help\\nme, do help me!\"\\n\\n\"I will, my child, I will.  Don\\'t cry so bitterly, but remember this\\nday, and resolve with all your soul that you will never know another\\nlike it.  Jo, dear, we all have our temptations, some far greater than\\nyours, and it often takes us all our lives to conquer them.  You think\\nyour temper is the worst in the world, but mine used to be just like\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"Yours, Mother?  Why, you are never angry!\"  And for the moment Jo\\nforgot remorse in surprise.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been trying to cure it for forty years, and have only succeeded\\nin controlling it.  I am angry nearly every day of my life, Jo, but I\\nhave learned not to show it, and I still hope to learn not to feel it,\\nthough it may take me another forty years to do so.\"\\n\\nThe patience and the humility of the face she loved so well was a\\nbetter lesson to Jo than the wisest lecture, the sharpest reproof.  She\\nfelt comforted at once by the sympathy and confidence given her.  The\\nknowledge that her mother had a fault like hers, and tried to mend it,\\nmade her own easier to bear and strengthened her resolution to cure it,\\nthough forty years seemed rather a long time to watch and pray to a\\ngirl of fifteen.\\n\\n\"Mother, are you angry when you fold your lips tight together and go\\nout of the room sometimes, when Aunt March scolds or people worry you?\"\\nasked Jo, feeling nearer and dearer to her mother than ever before.\\n\\n\"Yes, I\\'ve learned to check the hasty words that rise to my lips, and\\nwhen I feel that they mean to break out against my will, I just go away\\nfor a minute, and give myself a little shake for being so weak and\\nwicked,\" answered Mrs. March with a sigh and a smile, as she smoothed\\nand fastened up Jo\\'s disheveled hair.\\n\\n\"How did you learn to keep still?  That is what troubles me, for the\\nsharp words fly out before I know what I\\'m about, and the more I say\\nthe worse I get, till it\\'s a pleasure to hurt people\\'s feelings and say\\ndreadful things.  Tell me how you do it, Marmee dear.\"\\n\\n\"My good mother used to help me...\"\\n\\n\"As you do us...\" interrupted Jo, with a grateful kiss.\\n\\n\"But I lost her when I was a little older than you are, and for years\\nhad to struggle on alone, for I was too proud to confess my weakness to\\nanyone else.  I had a hard time, Jo, and shed a good many bitter tears\\nover my failures, for in spite of my efforts I never seemed to get on.\\nThen your father came, and I was so happy that I found it easy to be\\ngood.  But by-and-by, when I had four little daughters round me and we\\nwere poor, then the old trouble began again, for I am not patient by\\nnature, and it tried me very much to see my children wanting anything.\"\\n\\n\"Poor Mother!  What helped you then?\"\\n\\n\"Your father, Jo.  He never loses patience, never doubts or complains,\\nbut always hopes, and works and waits so cheerfully that one is ashamed\\nto do otherwise before him.  He helped and comforted me, and showed me\\nthat I must try to practice all the virtues I would have my little\\ngirls possess, for I was their example.  It was easier to try for your\\nsakes than for my own. A startled or surprised look from one of you\\nwhen I spoke sharply rebuked me more than any words could have done,\\nand the love, respect, and confidence of my children was the sweetest\\nreward I could receive for my efforts to be the woman I would have them\\ncopy.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Mother, if I\\'m ever half as good as you, I shall be satisfied,\"\\ncried Jo, much touched.\\n\\n\"I hope you will be a great deal better, dear, but you must keep watch\\nover your \\'bosom enemy\\', as father calls it, or it may sadden, if not\\nspoil your life.  You have had a warning. Remember it, and try with\\nheart and soul to master this quick temper, before it brings you\\ngreater sorrow and regret than you have known today.\"\\n\\n\"I will try, Mother, I truly will.  But you must help me, remind me,\\nand keep me from flying out.  I used to see Father sometimes put his\\nfinger on his lips, and look at you with a very kind but sober face,\\nand you always folded your lips tight and went away.  Was he reminding\\nyou then?\" asked Jo softly.\\n\\n\"Yes.  I asked him to help me so, and he never forgot it, but saved me\\nfrom many a sharp word by that little gesture and kind look.\"\\n\\nJo saw that her mother\\'s eyes filled and her lips trembled as she\\nspoke, and fearing that she had said too much, she whispered anxiously,\\n\"Was it wrong to watch you and to speak of it?  I didn\\'t mean to be\\nrude, but it\\'s so comfortable to say all I think to you, and feel so\\nsafe and happy here.\"\\n\\n\"My Jo, you may say anything to your mother, for it is my greatest\\nhappiness and pride to feel that my girls confide in me and know how\\nmuch I love them.\"\\n\\n\"I thought I\\'d grieved you.\"\\n\\n\"No, dear, but speaking of Father reminded me how much I miss him, how\\nmuch I owe him, and how faithfully I should watch and work to keep his\\nlittle daughters safe and good for him.\"\\n\\n\"Yet you told him to go, Mother, and didn\\'t cry when he went, and never\\ncomplain now, or seem as if you needed any help,\" said Jo, wondering.\\n\\n\"I gave my best to the country I love, and kept my tears till he was\\ngone.  Why should I complain, when we both have merely done our duty\\nand will surely be the happier for it in the end?  If I don\\'t seem to\\nneed help, it is because I have a better friend, even than Father, to\\ncomfort and sustain me.  My child, the troubles and temptations of your\\nlife are beginning and may be many, but you can overcome and outlive\\nthem all if you learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your\\nHeavenly Father as you do that of your earthly one.  The more you love\\nand trust Him, the nearer you will feel to Him, and the less you will\\ndepend on human power and wisdom.  His love and care never tire or\\nchange, can never be taken from you, but may become the source of\\nlifelong peace, happiness, and strength.  Believe this heartily, and go\\nto God with all your little cares, and hopes, and sins, and sorrows, as\\nfreely and confidingly as you come to your mother.\"\\n\\nJo\\'s only answer was to hold her mother close, and in the silence which\\nfollowed the sincerest prayer she had ever prayed left her heart\\nwithout words.  For in that sad yet happy hour, she had learned not\\nonly the bitterness of remorse and despair, but the sweetness of\\nself-denial and self-control, and led by her mother\\'s hand, she had\\ndrawn nearer to the Friend who always welcomes every child with a love\\nstronger than that of any father, tenderer than that of any mother.\\n\\nAmy stirred and sighed in her sleep, and as if eager to begin at once\\nto mend her fault, Jo looked up with an expression on her face which it\\nhad never worn before.\\n\\n\"I let the sun go down on my anger.  I wouldn\\'t forgive her, and today,\\nif it hadn\\'t been for Laurie, it might have been too late!  How could I\\nbe so wicked?\" said Jo, half aloud, as she leaned over her sister\\nsoftly stroking the wet hair scattered on the pillow.\\n\\nAs if she heard, Amy opened her eyes, and held out her arms, with a\\nsmile that went straight to Jo\\'s heart.  Neither said a word, but they\\nhugged one another close, in spite of the blankets, and everything was\\nforgiven and forgotten in one hearty kiss.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'NINE\\n\\nMEG GOES TO VANITY FAIR\\n\\n\"I do think it was the most fortunate thing in the world that those\\nchildren should have the measles just now,\" said Meg, one April day, as\\nshe stood packing the \\'go abroady\\' trunk in her room, surrounded by her\\nsisters.\\n\\n\"And so nice of Annie Moffat not to forget her promise.  A whole\\nfortnight of fun will be regularly splendid,\" replied Jo, looking like\\na windmill as she folded skirts with her long arms.\\n\\n\"And such lovely weather, I\\'m so glad of that,\" added Beth, tidily\\nsorting neck and hair ribbons in her best box, lent for the great\\noccasion.\\n\\n\"I wish I was going to have a fine time and wear all these nice\\nthings,\" said Amy with her mouth full of pins, as she artistically\\nreplenished her sister\\'s cushion.\\n\\n\"I wish you were all going, but as you can\\'t, I shall keep my\\nadventures to tell you when I come back.  I\\'m sure it\\'s the least I can\\ndo when you have been so kind, lending me things and helping me get\\nready,\" said Meg, glancing round the room at the very simple outfit,\\nwhich seemed nearly perfect in their eyes.\\n\\n\"What did Mother give you out of the treasure box?\" asked Amy, who had\\nnot been present at the opening of a certain cedar chest in which Mrs.\\nMarch kept a few relics of past splendor, as gifts for her girls when\\nthe proper time came.\\n\\n\"A pair of silk stockings, that pretty carved fan, and a lovely blue\\nsash.  I wanted the violet silk, but there isn\\'t time to make it over,\\nso I must be contented with my old tarlaton.\"\\n\\n\\n\"It will look nice over my new muslin skirt, and the sash will set it\\noff beautifully.  I wish I hadn\\'t smashed my coral bracelet, for you\\nmight have had it,\" said Jo, who loved to give and lend, but whose\\npossessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much use.\\n\\n\"There is a lovely old-fashioned pearl set in the treasure chest, but\\nMother said real flowers were the prettiest ornament for a young girl,\\nand Laurie promised to send me all I want,\" replied Meg.  \"Now, let me\\nsee, there\\'s my new gray walking suit, just curl up the feather in my\\nhat, Beth, then my poplin for Sunday and the small party, it looks\\nheavy for spring, doesn\\'t it?  The violet silk would be so nice.  Oh,\\ndear!\"\\n\\n\"Never mind, you\\'ve got the tarlaton for the big party, and you always\\nlook like an angel in white,\" said Amy, brooding over the little store\\nof finery in which her soul delighted.\\n\\n\"It isn\\'t low-necked, and it doesn\\'t sweep enough, but it will have to\\ndo.  My blue housedress looks so well, turned and freshly trimmed, that\\nI feel as if I\\'d got a new one.  My silk sacque isn\\'t a bit the\\nfashion, and my bonnet doesn\\'t look like Sallie\\'s.  I didn\\'t like to\\nsay anything, but I was sadly disappointed in my umbrella.  I told\\nMother black with a white handle, but she forgot and bought a green one\\nwith a yellowish handle.  It\\'s strong and neat, so I ought not to\\ncomplain, but I know I shall feel ashamed of it beside Annie\\'s silk one\\nwith a gold top,\" sighed Meg, surveying the little umbrella with great\\ndisfavor.\\n\\n\"Change it,\" advised Jo.\\n\\n\"I won\\'t be so silly, or hurt Marmee\\'s feelings, when she took so much\\npains to get my things.  It\\'s a nonsensical notion of mine, and I\\'m not\\ngoing to give up to it.  My silk stockings and two pairs of new gloves\\nare my comfort.  You are a dear to lend me yours, Jo.  I feel so rich\\nand sort of elegant, with two new pairs, and the old ones cleaned up\\nfor common.\"  And Meg took a refreshing peep at her glove box.\\n\\n\"Annie Moffat has blue and pink bows on her nightcaps. Would you put\\nsome on mine?\" she asked, as Beth brought up a pile of snowy muslins,\\nfresh from Hannah\\'s hands.\\n\\n\"No, I wouldn\\'t, for the smart caps won\\'t match the plain gowns without\\nany trimming on them.  Poor folks shouldn\\'t rig,\" said Jo decidedly.\\n\\n\"I wonder if I shall ever be happy enough to have real lace on my\\nclothes and bows on my caps?\" said Meg impatiently.\\n\\n\"You said the other day that you\\'d be perfectly happy if you could only\\ngo to Annie Moffat\\'s,\" observed Beth in her quiet way.\\n\\n\"So I did!  Well, I am happy, and I won\\'t fret, but it does seem as if\\nthe more one gets the more one wants, doesn\\'t it?  There now, the trays\\nare ready, and everything in but my ball dress, which I shall leave for\\nMother to pack,\" said Meg, cheering up, as she glanced from the\\nhalf-filled trunk to the many times pressed and mended white tarlaton,\\nwhich she called her \\'ball dress\\' with an important air.\\n\\nThe next day was fine, and Meg departed in style for a fortnight of\\nnovelty and pleasure.  Mrs. March had consented to the visit rather\\nreluctantly, fearing that Margaret would come back more discontented\\nthan she went.  But she begged so hard, and Sallie had promised to take\\ngood care of her, and a little pleasure seemed so delightful after a\\nwinter of irksome work that the mother yielded, and the daughter went\\nto take her first taste of fashionable life.\\n\\nThe Moffats were very fashionable, and simple Meg was rather daunted,\\nat first, by the splendor of the house and the elegance of its\\noccupants.  But they were kindly people, in spite of the frivolous life\\nthey led, and soon put their guest at her ease. Perhaps Meg felt,\\nwithout understanding why, that they were not particularly cultivated\\nor intelligent people, and that all their gilding could not quite\\nconceal the ordinary material of which they were made.  It certainly\\nwas agreeable to fare sumptuously, drive in a fine carriage, wear her\\nbest frock every day, and do nothing but enjoy herself.  It suited her\\nexactly, and soon she began to imitate the manners and conversation of\\nthose about her, to put on little airs and graces, use French phrases,\\ncrimp her hair, take in her dresses, and talk about the fashions as\\nwell as she could.  The more she saw of Annie Moffat\\'s pretty things,\\nthe more she envied her and sighed to be rich.  Home now looked bare\\nand dismal as she thought of it, work grew harder than ever, and she\\nfelt that she was a very destitute and much-injured girl, in spite of\\nthe new gloves and silk stockings.\\n\\nShe had not much time for repining, however, for the three young girls\\nwere busily employed in \\'having a good time\\'.  They shopped, walked,\\nrode, and called all day, went to theaters and operas or frolicked at\\nhome in the evening, for Annie had many friends and knew how to\\nentertain them.  Her older sisters were very fine young ladies, and one\\nwas engaged, which was extremely interesting and romantic, Meg thought.\\nMr. Moffat was a fat, jolly old gentleman, who knew her father, and\\nMrs. Moffat, a fat, jolly old lady, who took as great a fancy to Meg as\\nher daughter had done.  Everyone petted her, and \\'Daisey\\', as they\\ncalled her, was in a fair way to have her head turned.\\n\\nWhen the evening for the small party came, she found that the poplin\\nwouldn\\'t do at all, for the other girls were putting on thin dresses\\nand making themselves very fine indeed.  So out came the tarlatan,\\nlooking older, limper, and shabbier than ever beside Sallie\\'s crisp new\\none.  Meg saw the girls glance at it and then at one another, and her\\ncheeks began to burn, for with all her gentleness she was very proud.\\nNo one said a word about it, but Sallie offered to dress her hair, and\\nAnnie to tie her sash, and Belle, the engaged sister, praised her white\\narms.  But in their kindness Meg saw only pity for her poverty, and her\\nheart felt very heavy as she stood by herself, while the others\\nlaughed, chattered, and flew about like gauzy butterflies.  The hard,\\nbitter feeling was getting pretty bad, when the maid brought in a box\\nof flowers.  Before she could speak, Annie had the cover off, and all\\nwere exclaiming at the lovely roses, heath, and fern within.\\n\\n\"It\\'s for Belle, of course, George always sends her some, but these are\\naltogether ravishing,\" cried Annie, with a great sniff.\\n\\n\"They are for Miss March, the man said.  And here\\'s a note,\" put in the\\nmaid, holding it to Meg.\\n\\n\"What fun!  Who are they from?  Didn\\'t know you had a lover,\" cried the\\ngirls, fluttering about Meg in a high state of curiosity and surprise.\\n\\n\"The note is from Mother, and the flowers from Laurie,\" said Meg\\nsimply, yet much gratified that he had not forgotten her.\\n\\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said Annie with a funny look, as Meg slipped the note\\ninto her pocket as a sort of talisman against envy, vanity, and false\\npride, for the few loving words had done her good, and the flowers\\ncheered her up by their beauty.\\n\\nFeeling almost happy again, she laid by a few ferns and roses for\\nherself, and quickly made up the rest in dainty bouquets for the\\nbreasts, hair, or skirts of her friends, offering them so prettily that\\nClara, the elder sister, told her she was \\'the sweetest little thing\\nshe ever saw\\', and they looked quite charmed with her small attention.\\nSomehow the kind act finished her despondency, and when all the rest\\nwent to show themselves to Mrs. Moffat, she saw a happy, bright-eyed\\nface in the mirror, as she laid her ferns against her rippling hair and\\nfastened the roses in the dress that didn\\'t strike her as so very\\nshabby now.\\n\\nShe enjoyed herself very much that evening, for she danced to her\\nheart\\'s content.  Everyone was very kind, and she had three\\ncompliments.  Annie made her sing, and some one said she had a\\nremarkably fine voice.  Major Lincoln asked who \\'the fresh little girl\\nwith the beautiful eyes\\' was, and Mr. Moffat insisted on dancing with\\nher because she \\'didn\\'t dawdle, but had some spring in her\\', as he\\ngracefully expressed it.  So altogether she had a very nice time, till\\nshe overheard a bit of conversation, which disturbed her extremely.\\nShe was sitting just inside the conservatory, waiting for her partner\\nto bring her an ice, when she heard a voice ask on the other side of\\nthe flowery wall...\\n\\n\"How old is he?\"\\n\\n\"Sixteen or seventeen, I should say,\" replied another voice.\\n\\n\"It would be a grand thing for one of those girls, wouldn\\'t it?  Sallie\\nsays they are very intimate now, and the old man quite dotes on them.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. M.  has made her plans, I dare say, and will play her cards well,\\nearly as it is.  The girl evidently doesn\\'t think of it yet,\" said Mrs.\\nMoffat.\\n\\n\"She told that fib about her momma, as if she did know, and colored up\\nwhen the flowers came quite prettily.  Poor thing! She\\'d be so nice if\\nshe was only got up in style.  Do you think she\\'d be offended if we\\noffered to lend her a dress for Thursday?\" asked another voice.\\n\\n\"She\\'s proud, but I don\\'t believe she\\'d mind, for that dowdy tarlaton\\nis all she has got.  She may tear it tonight, and that will be a good\\nexcuse for offering a decent one.\"\\n\\nHere Meg\\'s partner appeared, to find her looking much flushed and\\nrather agitated.  She was proud, and her pride was useful just then,\\nfor it helped her hide her mortification, anger, and disgust at what\\nshe had just heard.  For, innocent and unsuspicious as she was, she\\ncould not help understanding the gossip of her friends.  She tried to\\nforget it, but could not, and kept repeating to herself, \"Mrs. M.  has\\nmade her plans,\" \"that fib about her mamma,\" and \"dowdy tarlaton,\" till\\nshe was ready to cry and rush home to tell her troubles and ask for\\nadvice.  As that was impossible, she did her best to seem gay, and\\nbeing rather excited, she succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an\\neffort she was making. She was very glad when it was all over and she\\nwas quiet in her bed, where she could think and wonder and fume till\\nher head ached and her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears.\\nThose foolish, yet well meant words, had opened a new world to Meg, and\\nmuch disturbed the peace of the old one in which till now she had lived\\nas happily as a child.  Her innocent friendship with Laurie was spoiled\\nby the silly speeches she had overheard.  Her faith in her mother was a\\nlittle shaken by the worldly plans attributed to her by Mrs. Moffat,\\nwho judged others by herself, and the sensible resolution to be\\ncontented with the simple wardrobe which suited a poor man\\'s daughter\\nwas weakened by the unnecessary pity of girls who thought a shabby\\ndress one of the greatest calamities under heaven.\\n\\nPoor Meg had a restless night, and got up heavy-eyed, unhappy, half\\nresentful toward her friends, and half ashamed of herself for not\\nspeaking out frankly and setting everything right.  Everybody dawdled\\nthat morning, and it was noon before the girls found energy enough even\\nto take up their worsted work.  Something in the manner of her friends\\nstruck Meg at once.  They treated her with more respect, she thought,\\ntook quite a tender interest in what she said, and looked at her with\\neyes that plainly betrayed curiosity.  All this surprised and flattered\\nher, though she did not understand it till Miss Belle looked up from\\nher writing, and said, with a sentimental air...\\n\\n\"Daisy, dear, I\\'ve sent an invitation to your friend, Mr. Laurence, for\\nThursday.  We should like to know him, and it\\'s only a proper\\ncompliment to you.\"\\n\\nMeg colored, but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made her reply\\ndemurely, \"You are very kind, but I\\'m afraid he won\\'t come.\"\\n\\n\"Why not, Cherie?\" asked Miss Belle.\\n\\n\"He\\'s too old.\"\\n\\n\"My child, what do you mean?  What is his age, I beg to know!\" cried\\nMiss Clara.\\n\\n\"Nearly seventy, I believe,\" answered Meg, counting stitches to hide\\nthe merriment in her eyes.\\n\\n\"You sly creature!  Of course we meant the young man,\" exclaimed Miss\\nBelle, laughing.\\n\\n\"There isn\\'t any, Laurie is only a little boy.\"  And Meg laughed also\\nat the queer look which the sisters exchanged as she thus described her\\nsupposed lover.\\n\\n\"About your age,\" Nan said.\\n\\n\"Nearer my sister Jo\\'s; I am seventeen in August,\" returned Meg,\\ntossing her head.\\n\\n\"It\\'s very nice of him to send you flowers, isn\\'t it?\" said Annie,\\nlooking wise about nothing.\\n\\n\"Yes, he often does, to all of us, for their house is full, and we are\\nso fond of them.  My mother and old Mr. Laurence are friends, you know,\\nso it is quite natural that we children should play together,\" and Meg\\nhoped they would say no more.\\n\\n\"It\\'s evident Daisy isn\\'t out yet,\" said Miss Clara to Belle with a nod.\\n\\n\"Quite a pastoral state of innocence all round,\" returned Miss Belle\\nwith a shrug.\\n\\n\"I\\'m going out to get some little matters for my girls.  Can I do\\nanything for you, young ladies?\" asked Mrs. Moffat, lumbering in like\\nan elephant in silk and lace.\\n\\n\"No, thank you, ma\\'am,\" replied Sallie.  \"I\\'ve got my new pink silk for\\nThursday and don\\'t want a thing.\"\\n\\n\"Nor I...\" began Meg, but stopped because it occurred to her that she\\ndid want several things and could not have them.\\n\\n\"What shall you wear?\" asked Sallie.\\n\\n\"My old white one again, if I can mend it fit to be seen, it got sadly\\ntorn last night,\" said Meg, trying to speak quite easily, but feeling\\nvery uncomfortable.\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you send home for another?\" said Sallie, who was not an\\nobserving young lady.\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t got any other.\"  It cost Meg an effort to say that, but\\nSallie did not see it and exclaimed in amiable surprise, \"Only that?\\nHow funny...\"  She did not finish her speech, for Belle shook her head\\nat her and broke in, saying kindly...\\n\\n\"Not at all.  Where is the use of having a lot of dresses when she\\nisn\\'t out yet?  There\\'s no need of sending home, Daisy, even if you had\\na dozen, for I\\'ve got a sweet blue silk laid away, which I\\'ve outgrown,\\nand you shall wear it to please me, won\\'t you, dear?\"\\n\\n\"You are very kind, but I don\\'t mind my old dress if you don\\'t, it does\\nwell enough for a little girl like me,\" said Meg.\\n\\n\"Now do let me please myself by dressing you up in style. I admire to\\ndo it, and you\\'d be a regular little beauty with a touch here and\\nthere.  I shan\\'t let anyone see you till you are done, and then we\\'ll\\nburst upon them like Cinderella and her godmother going to the ball,\"\\nsaid Belle in her persuasive tone.\\n\\nMeg couldn\\'t refuse the offer so kindly made, for a desire to see if\\nshe would be \\'a little beauty\\' after touching up caused her to accept\\nand forget all her former uncomfortable feelings toward the Moffats.\\n\\nOn the Thursday evening, Belle shut herself up with her maid, and\\nbetween them they turned Meg into a fine lady.  They crimped and curled\\nher hair, they polished her neck and arms with some fragrant powder,\\ntouched her lips with coralline salve to make them redder, and Hortense\\nwould have added \\'a soupcon of rouge\\', if Meg had not rebelled.  They\\nlaced her into a sky-blue dress, which was so tight she could hardly\\nbreathe and so low in the neck that modest Meg blushed at herself in\\nthe mirror.  A set of silver filagree was added, bracelets, necklace,\\nbrooch, and even earrings, for Hortense tied them on with a bit of pink\\nsilk which did not show.  A cluster of tea-rose buds at the bosom, and\\na ruche, reconciled Meg to the display of her pretty, white shoulders,\\nand a pair of high-heeled silk boots satisfied the last wish of her\\nheart.  A lace handkerchief, a plumy fan, and a bouquet in a shoulder\\nholder finished her off, and Miss Belle surveyed her with the\\nsatisfaction of a little girl with a newly dressed doll.\\n\\n\"Mademoiselle is charmante, tres jolie, is she not?\" cried Hortense,\\nclasping her hands in an affected rapture.\\n\\n\"Come and show yourself,\" said Miss Belle, leading the way to the room\\nwhere the others were waiting.\\n\\nAs Meg went rustling after, with her long skirts trailing, her earrings\\ntinkling, her curls waving, and her heart beating, she felt as if her\\nfun had really begun at last, for the mirror had plainly told her that\\nshe was \\'a little beauty\\'.  Her friends repeated the pleasing phrase\\nenthusiastically, and for several minutes she stood, like a jackdaw in\\nthe fable, enjoying her borrowed plumes, while the rest chattered like\\na party of magpies.\\n\\n\"While I dress, do you drill her, Nan, in the management of her skirt\\nand those French heels, or she will trip herself up.  Take your silver\\nbutterfly, and catch up that long curl on the left side of her head,\\nClara, and don\\'t any of you disturb the charming work of my hands,\"\\nsaid Belle, as she hurried away, looking well pleased with her success.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t look a bit like yourself, but you are very nice. I\\'m nowhere\\nbeside you, for Belle has heaps of taste, and you\\'re quite French, I\\nassure you.  Let your flowers hang, don\\'t be so careful of them, and be\\nsure you don\\'t trip,\" returned Sallie, trying not to care that Meg was\\nprettier than herself.\\n\\nKeeping that warning carefully in mind, Margaret got safely down stairs\\nand sailed into the drawing rooms where the Moffats and a few early\\nguests were assembled.  She very soon discovered that there is a charm\\nabout fine clothes which attracts a certain class of people and secures\\ntheir respect.  Several young ladies, who had taken no notice of her\\nbefore, were very affectionate all of a sudden.  Several young\\ngentlemen, who had only stared at her at the other party, now not only\\nstared, but asked to be introduced, and said all manner of foolish but\\nagreeable things to her, and several old ladies, who sat on the sofas,\\nand criticized the rest of the party, inquired who she was with an air\\nof interest.  She heard Mrs. Moffat reply to one of them...\\n\\n\"Daisy March--father a colonel in the army--one of our first families,\\nbut reverses of fortune, you know; intimate friends of the Laurences;\\nsweet creature, I assure you; my Ned is quite wild about her.\"\\n\\n\"Dear me!\" said the old lady, putting up her glass for another\\nobservation of Meg, who tried to look as if she had not heard and been\\nrather shocked at Mrs. Moffat\\'s fibs. The \\'queer feeling\\' did not pass\\naway, but she imagined herself acting the new part of fine lady and so\\ngot on pretty well, though the tight dress gave her a side-ache, the\\ntrain kept getting under her feet, and she was in constant fear lest\\nher earrings should fly off and get lost or broken.  She was flirting\\nher fan and laughing at the feeble jokes of a young gentleman who tried\\nto be witty, when she suddenly stopped laughing and looked confused,\\nfor just opposite, she saw Laurie.  He was staring at her with\\nundisguised surprise, and disapproval also, she thought, for though he\\nbowed and smiled, yet something in his honest eyes made her blush and\\nwish she had her old dress on. To complete her confusion, she saw Belle\\nnudge Annie, and both glance from her to Laurie, who, she was happy to\\nsee, looked unusually boyish and shy.\\n\\n\"Silly creatures, to put such thoughts into my head.  I won\\'t care for\\nit, or let it change me a bit,\" thought Meg, and rustled across the\\nroom to shake hands with her friend.\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad you came, I was afraid you wouldn\\'t.\" she said, with her most\\ngrown-up air.\\n\\n\"Jo wanted me to come, and tell her how you looked, so I did,\" answered\\nLaurie, without turning his eyes upon her, though he half smiled at her\\nmaternal tone.\\n\\n\"What shall you tell her?\" asked Meg, full of curiosity to know his\\nopinion of her, yet feeling ill at ease with him for the first time.\\n\\n\"I shall say I didn\\'t know you, for you look so grown-up and unlike\\nyourself, I\\'m quite afraid of you,\" he said, fumbling at his glove\\nbutton.\\n\\n\"How absurd of you!  The girls dressed me up for fun, and I rather like\\nit.  Wouldn\\'t Jo stare if she saw me?\" said Meg, bent on making him say\\nwhether he thought her improved or not.\\n\\n\"Yes, I think she would,\" returned Laurie gravely.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you like me so?\" asked Meg.\\n\\n\"No, I don\\'t,\" was the blunt reply.\\n\\n\"Why not?\" in an anxious tone.\\n\\nHe glanced at her frizzled head, bare shoulders, and fantastically\\ntrimmed dress with an expression that abashed her more than his answer,\\nwhich had not a particle of his usual politeness in it.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t like fuss and feathers.\"\\n\\nThat was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself, and Meg\\nwalked away, saying petulantly, \"You are the rudest boy I ever saw.\"\\n\\nFeeling very much ruffled, she went and stood at a quiet window to cool\\nher cheeks, for the tight dress gave her an uncomfortably brilliant\\ncolor.  As she stood there, Major Lincoln passed by, and a minute after\\nshe heard him saying to his mother...\\n\\n\"They are making a fool of that little girl.  I wanted you to see her,\\nbut they have spoiled her entirely.  She\\'s nothing but a doll tonight.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, dear!\" sighed Meg.  \"I wish I\\'d been sensible and worn my own\\nthings, then I should not have disgusted other people, or felt so\\nuncomfortable and ashamed of myself.\"\\n\\nShe leaned her forehead on the cool pane, and stood half hidden by the\\ncurtains, never minding that her favorite waltz had begun, till some\\none touched her, and turning, she saw Laurie, looking penitent, as he\\nsaid, with his very best bow and his hand out...\\n\\n\"Please forgive my rudeness, and come and dance with me.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid it will be too disagreeable to you,\" said Meg, trying to\\nlook offended and failing entirely.\\n\\n\"Not a bit of it, I\\'m dying to do it.  Come, I\\'ll be good. I don\\'t like\\nyour gown, but I do think you are just splendid.\" And he waved his\\nhands, as if words failed to express his admiration.\\n\\nMeg smiled and relented, and whispered as they stood waiting to catch\\nthe time, \"Take care my skirt doesn\\'t trip you up.  It\\'s the plague of\\nmy life and I was a goose to wear it.\"\\n\\n\"Pin it round your neck, and then it will be useful,\" said Laurie,\\nlooking down at the little blue boots, which he evidently approved of.\\n\\nAway they went fleetly and gracefully, for having practiced at home,\\nthey were well matched, and the blithe young couple were a pleasant\\nsight to see, as they twirled merrily round and round, feeling more\\nfriendly than ever after their small tiff.\\n\\n\"Laurie, I want you to do me a favor, will you?\" said Meg, as he stood\\nfanning her when her breath gave out, which it did very soon though she\\nwould not own why.\\n\\n\"Won\\'t I!\" said Laurie, with alacrity.\\n\\n\"Please don\\'t tell them at home about my dress tonight. They won\\'t\\nunderstand the joke, and it will worry Mother.\"\\n\\n\"Then why did you do it?\" said Laurie\\'s eyes, so plainly that Meg\\nhastily added...\\n\\n\"I shall tell them myself all about it, and \\'fess\\' to Mother how silly\\nI\\'ve been.  But I\\'d rather do it myself.  So you\\'ll not tell, will you?\"\\n\\n\"I give you my word I won\\'t, only what shall I say when they ask me?\"\\n\\n\"Just say I looked pretty well and was having a good time.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll say the first with all my heart, but how about the other?  You\\ndon\\'t look as if you were having a good time.  Are you?\" And Laurie\\nlooked at her with an expression which made her answer in a whisper...\\n\\n\"No, not just now.  Don\\'t think I\\'m horrid.  I only wanted a little\\nfun, but this sort doesn\\'t pay, I find, and I\\'m getting tired of it.\"\\n\\n\"Here comes Ned Moffat.  What does he want?\" said Laurie, knitting his\\nblack brows as if he did not regard his young host in the light of a\\npleasant addition to the party.\\n\\n\"He put his name down for three dances, and I suppose he\\'s coming for\\nthem.  What a bore!\" said Meg, assuming a languid air which amused\\nLaurie immensely.\\n\\nHe did not speak to her again till suppertime, when he saw her drinking\\nchampagne with Ned and his friend Fisher, who were behaving \\'like a\\npair of fools\\', as Laurie said to himself, for he felt a brotherly sort\\nof right to watch over the Marches and fight their battles whenever a\\ndefender was needed.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll have a splitting headache tomorrow, if you drink much of that.\\nI wouldn\\'t, Meg, your mother doesn\\'t like it, you know,\" he whispered,\\nleaning over her chair, as Ned turned to refill her glass and Fisher\\nstooped to pick up her fan.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not Meg tonight, I\\'m \\'a doll\\' who does all sorts of crazy things.\\nTomorrow I shall put away my \\'fuss and feathers\\' and be desperately\\ngood again,\" she answered with an affected little laugh.\\n\\n\"Wish tomorrow was here, then,\" muttered Laurie, walking off,\\nill-pleased at the change he saw in her.\\n\\nMeg danced and flirted, chattered and giggled, as the other girls did.\\nAfter supper she undertook the German, and blundered through it, nearly\\nupsetting her partner with her long skirt, and romping in a way that\\nscandalized Laurie, who looked on and meditated a lecture.  But he got\\nno chance to deliver it, for Meg kept away from him till he came to say\\ngood night.\\n\\n\"Remember!\" she said, trying to smile, for the splitting headache had\\nalready begun.\\n\\n\"Silence a la mort,\" replied Laurie, with a melodramatic flourish, as\\nhe went away.\\n\\nThis little bit of byplay excited Annie\\'s curiosity, but Meg was too\\ntired for gossip and went to bed, feeling as if she had been to a\\nmasquerade and hadn\\'t enjoyed herself as much as she expected.  She was\\nsick all the next day, and on Saturday went home, quite used up with\\nher fortnight\\'s fun and feeling that she had \\'sat in the lap of luxury\\'\\nlong enough.\\n\\n\"It does seem pleasant to be quiet, and not have company manners on all\\nthe time.  Home is a nice place, though it isn\\'t splendid,\" said Meg,\\nlooking about her with a restful expression, as she sat with her mother\\nand Jo on the Sunday evening.\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad to hear you say so, dear, for I was afraid home would seem\\ndull and poor to you after your fine quarters,\" replied her mother, who\\nhad given her many anxious looks that day.  For motherly eyes are quick\\nto see any change in children\\'s faces.\\n\\nMeg had told her adventures gayly and said over and over what a\\ncharming time she had had, but something still seemed to weigh upon her\\nspirits, and when the younger girls were gone to bed, she sat\\nthoughtfully staring at the fire, saying little and looking worried.\\nAs the clock struck nine and Jo proposed bed, Meg suddenly left her\\nchair and, taking Beth\\'s stool, leaned her elbows on her mother\\'s knee,\\nsaying bravely...\\n\\n\"Marmee, I want to \\'fess\\'.\"\\n\\n\"I thought so.  What is it, dear?\"\\n\\n\"Shall I go away?\" asked Jo discreetly.\\n\\n\"Of course not.  Don\\'t I always tell you everything?  I was ashamed to\\nspeak of it before the younger children, but I want you to know all the\\ndreadful things I did at the Moffats\\'.\"\\n\\n\"We are prepared,\" said Mrs. March, smiling but looking a little\\nanxious.\\n\\n\"I told you they dressed me up, but I didn\\'t tell you that they\\npowdered and squeezed and frizzled, and made me look like a\\nfashion-plate.  Laurie thought I wasn\\'t proper.  I know he did, though\\nhe didn\\'t say so, and one man called me \\'a doll\\'.  I knew it was silly,\\nbut they flattered me and said I was a beauty, and quantities of\\nnonsense, so I let them make a fool of me.\"\\n\\n\"Is that all?\" asked Jo, as Mrs. March looked silently at the downcast\\nface of her pretty daughter, and could not find it in her heart to\\nblame her little follies.\\n\\n\"No, I drank champagne and romped and tried to flirt, and was\\naltogether abominable,\" said Meg self-reproachfully.\\n\\n\"There is something more, I think.\"  And Mrs. March smoothed the soft\\ncheek, which suddenly grew rosy as Meg answered slowly...\\n\\n\"Yes.  It\\'s very silly, but I want to tell it, because I hate to have\\npeople say and think such things about us and Laurie.\"\\n\\nThen she told the various bits of gossip she had heard at the Moffats\\',\\nand as she spoke, Jo saw her mother fold her lips tightly, as if ill\\npleased that such ideas should be put into Meg\\'s innocent mind.\\n\\n\"Well, if that isn\\'t the greatest rubbish I ever heard,\" cried Jo\\nindignantly.  \"Why didn\\'t you pop out and tell them so on the spot?\"\\n\\n\"I couldn\\'t, it was so embarrassing for me.  I couldn\\'t help hearing at\\nfirst, and then I was so angry and ashamed, I didn\\'t remember that I\\nought to go away.\"\\n\\n\"Just wait till I see Annie Moffat, and I\\'ll show you how to settle\\nsuch ridiculous stuff.  The idea of having \\'plans\\' and being kind to\\nLaurie because he\\'s rich and may marry us by-and-by!  Won\\'t he shout\\nwhen I tell him what those silly things say about us poor children?\"\\nAnd Jo laughed, as if on second thoughts the thing struck her as a good\\njoke.\\n\\n\"If you tell Laurie, I\\'ll never forgive you!  She mustn\\'t, must she,\\nMother?\" said Meg, looking distressed.\\n\\n\"No, never repeat that foolish gossip, and forget it as soon as you\\ncan,\" said Mrs. March gravely.  \"I was very unwise to let you go among\\npeople of whom I know so little, kind, I dare say, but worldly,\\nill-bred, and full of these vulgar ideas about young people.  I am more\\nsorry than I can express for the mischief this visit may have done you,\\nMeg.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be sorry, I won\\'t let it hurt me.  I\\'ll forget all the bad and\\nremember only the good, for I did enjoy a great deal, and thank you\\nvery much for letting me go.  I\\'ll not be sentimental or dissatisfied,\\nMother.  I know I\\'m a silly little girl, and I\\'ll stay with you till\\nI\\'m fit to take care of myself.  But it is nice to be praised and\\nadmired, and I can\\'t help saying I like it,\" said Meg, looking half\\nashamed of the confession.\\n\\n\"That is perfectly natural, and quite harmless, if the liking does not\\nbecome a passion and lead one to do foolish or unmaidenly things.\\nLearn to know and value the praise which is worth having, and to excite\\nthe admiration of excellent people by being modest as well as pretty,\\nMeg.\"\\n\\nMargaret sat thinking a moment, while Jo stood with her hands behind\\nher, looking both interested and a little perplexed, for it was a new\\nthing to see Meg blushing and talking about admiration, lovers, and\\nthings of that sort.  And Jo felt as if during that fortnight her\\nsister had grown up amazingly, and was drifting away from her into a\\nworld where she could not follow.\\n\\n\"Mother, do you have \\'plans\\', as Mrs. Moffat said?\" asked Meg bashfully.\\n\\n\"Yes, my dear, I have a great many, all mothers do, but mine differ\\nsomewhat from Mrs. Moffat\\'s, I suspect.  I will tell you some of them,\\nfor the time has come when a word may set this romantic little head and\\nheart of yours right, on a very serious subject.  You are young, Meg,\\nbut not too young to understand me, and mothers\\' lips are the fittest\\nto speak of such things to girls like you.  Jo, your turn will come in\\ntime, perhaps, so listen to my \\'plans\\' and help me carry them out, if\\nthey are good.\"\\n\\nJo went and sat on one arm of the chair, looking as if she thought they\\nwere about to join in some very solemn affair. Holding a hand of each,\\nand watching the two young faces wistfully, Mrs. March said, in her\\nserious yet cheery way...\\n\\n\"I want my daughters to be beautiful, accomplished, and good. To be\\nadmired, loved, and respected.  To have a happy youth, to be well and\\nwisely married, and to lead useful, pleasant lives, with as little care\\nand sorrow to try them as God sees fit to send. To be loved and chosen\\nby a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a\\nwoman, and I sincerely hope my girls may know this beautiful\\nexperience.  It is natural to think of it, Meg, right to hope and wait\\nfor it, and wise to prepare for it, so that when the happy time comes,\\nyou may feel ready for the duties and worthy of the joy.  My dear\\ngirls, I am ambitious for you, but not to have you make a dash in the\\nworld, marry rich men merely because they are rich, or have splendid\\nhouses, which are not homes because love is wanting.  Money is a\\nneedful and precious thing, and when well used, a noble thing, but I\\nnever want you to think it is the first or only prize to strive for.\\nI\\'d rather see you poor men\\'s wives, if you were happy, beloved,\\ncontented, than queens on thrones, without self-respect and peace.\"\\n\\n\"Poor girls don\\'t stand any chance, Belle says, unless they put\\nthemselves forward,\" sighed Meg.\\n\\n\"Then we\\'ll be old maids,\" said Jo stoutly.\\n\\n\"Right, Jo.  Better be happy old maids than unhappy wives, or\\nunmaidenly girls, running about to find husbands,\" said Mrs. March\\ndecidedly.  \"Don\\'t be troubled, Meg, poverty seldom daunts a sincere\\nlover.  Some of the best and most honored women I know were poor girls,\\nbut so love-worthy that they were not allowed to be old maids. Leave\\nthese things to time.  Make this home happy, so that you may be fit for\\nhomes of your own, if they are offered you, and contented here if they\\nare not.  One thing remember, my girls.  Mother is always ready to be\\nyour confidant, Father to be your friend, and both of us hope and trust\\nthat our daughters, whether married or single, will be the pride and\\ncomfort of our lives.\"\\n\\n\"We will, Marmee, we will!\" cried both, with all their hearts, as she\\nbade them good night.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'TEN\\n\\nTHE P.C. AND P.O.\\n\\nAs spring came on, a new set of amusements became the fashion, and the\\nlengthening days gave long afternoons for work and play of all sorts.\\nThe garden had to be put in order, and each sister had a quarter of the\\nlittle plot to do what she liked with.  Hannah used to say, \"I\\'d know\\nwhich each of them gardings belonged to, ef I see \\'em in Chiny,\" and so\\nshe might, for the girls\\' tastes differed as much as their characters.\\nMeg\\'s had roses and heliotrope, myrtle, and a little orange tree in it.\\nJo\\'s bed was never alike two seasons, for she was always trying\\nexperiments.  This year it was to be a plantation of sun flowers, the\\nseeds of which cheerful and aspiring plant were to feed Aunt\\nCockle-top and her family of chicks.  Beth had old-fashioned fragrant\\nflowers in her garden, sweet peas and mignonette, larkspur, pinks,\\npansies, and southernwood, with chickweed for the birds and catnip for\\nthe pussies.  Amy had a bower in hers, rather small and earwiggy, but\\nvery pretty to look at, with honeysuckle and morning-glories hanging\\ntheir colored horns and bells in graceful wreaths all over it, tall\\nwhite lilies, delicate ferns, and as many brilliant, picturesque plants\\nas would consent to blossom there.\\n\\nGardening, walks, rows on the river, and flower hunts employed the fine\\ndays, and for rainy ones, they had house diversions, some old, some\\nnew, all more or less original.  One of these was the \\'P.C.\\', for as\\nsecret societies were the fashion, it was thought proper to have one,\\nand as all of the girls admired Dickens, they called themselves the\\nPickwick Club.  With a few interruptions, they had kept this up for a\\nyear, and met every Saturday evening in the big garret, on which\\noccasions the ceremonies were as follows:  Three chairs were arranged\\nin a row before a table on which was a lamp, also four white badges,\\nwith a big \\'P.C.\\' in different colors on each, and the weekly newspaper\\ncalled, The Pickwick Portfolio, to which all contributed something,\\nwhile Jo, who reveled in pens and ink, was the editor. At seven\\no\\'clock, the four members ascended to the clubroom, tied their badges\\nround their heads, and took their seats with great solemnity.  Meg, as\\nthe eldest, was Samuel Pickwick, Jo, being of a literary turn, Augustus\\nSnodgrass, Beth, because she was round and rosy, Tracy Tupman, and Amy,\\nwho was always trying to do what she couldn\\'t, was Nathaniel Winkle.\\nPickwick, the president, read the paper, which was filled with original\\ntales, poetry, local news, funny advertisements, and hints, in which\\nthey good-naturedly reminded each other of their faults and short\\ncomings.  On one occasion, Mr. Pickwick put on a pair of spectacles\\nwithout any glass, rapped upon the table, hemmed, and having stared\\nhard at Mr. Snodgrass, who was tilting back in his chair, till he\\narranged himself properly, began to read:\\n\\n    _________________________________________________\\n\\n    \"THE PICKWICK PORTFOLIO\"\\n\\n\\n\\n    MAY 20, 18--\\n\\n    POET\\'S CORNER\\n\\n    ANNIVERSARY ODE\\n\\n\\n    Again we meet to celebrate\\n    With badge and solemn rite,\\n    Our fifty-second anniversary,\\n    In Pickwick Hall, tonight.\\n\\n    We all are here in perfect health,\\n    None gone from our small band:\\n    Again we see each well-known face,\\n    And press each friendly hand.\\n\\n    Our Pickwick, always at his post,\\n    With reverence we greet,\\n    As, spectacles on nose, he reads\\n    Our well-filled weekly sheet.\\n\\n    Although he suffers from a cold,\\n    We joy to hear him speak,\\n    For words of wisdom from him fall,\\n    In spite of croak or squeak.\\n\\n    Old six-foot Snodgrass looms on high,\\n    With elephantine grace,\\n    And beams upon the company,\\n    With brown and jovial face.\\n\\n    Poetic fire lights up his eye,\\n    He struggles \\'gainst his lot.\\n    Behold ambition on his brow,\\n    And on his nose, a blot.\\n\\n    Next our peaceful Tupman comes,\\n    So rosy, plump, and sweet,\\n    Who chokes with laughter at the puns,\\n    And tumbles off his seat.\\n\\n    Prim little Winkle too is here,\\n    With every hair in place,\\n    A model of propriety,\\n    Though he hates to wash his face.\\n\\n    The year is gone, we still unite\\n    To joke and laugh and read,\\n    And tread the path of literature\\n    That doth to glory lead.\\n\\n    Long may our paper prosper well,\\n    Our club unbroken be,\\n    And coming years their blessings pour\\n    On the useful, gay \\'P.

Knights and ladies, elves and pages, monks\\n    and flower girls, all mingled gaily in the dance.\\n    Sweet voices and rich melody filled the air, and so\\n    with mirth and music the masquerade went on.\\n    \"Has your Highness seen the Lady Viola tonight?\"\\n    asked a gallant troubadour of the fairy queen who\\n    floated down the hall upon his arm.\\n\\n    \"Yes, is she not lovely, though so sad!  Her\\n    dress is well chosen, too, for in a week she weds\\n    Count Antonio, whom she passionately hates.\"\\n\\n    \"By my faith, I envy him.  Yonder he comes,\\n    arrayed like a bridegroom, except the black mask.\\n    When that is off we shall see how he regards the\\n    fair maid whose heart he cannot win, though her\\n    stern father bestows her hand,\" returned the troubadour.\\n\\n    \"Tis whispered that she loves the young English\\n    artist who haunts her steps, and is spurned by the\\n    old Count,\" said the lady, as they joined the dance.\\n    The revel was at its height when a priest\\n    appeared, and withdrawing the young pair to an alcove,\\n    hung with purple velvet, he motioned them to kneel.\\n    Instant silence fell on the gay throng, and not a\\n    sound, but the dash of fountains or the rustle of\\n    orange groves sleeping in the moonlight, broke the\\n    hush, as Count de Adelon spoke thus:\\n\\n    \"My lords and ladies, pardon the ruse by which\\n    I have gathered you here to witness the marriage of\\n    my daughter.  Father, we wait your services.\"\\n    All eyes turned toward the bridal party, and a\\n    murmur of amazement went through the throng, for\\n    neither bride nor groom removed their masks.  Curiosity\\n    and wonder possessed all hearts, but respect restrained\\n    all tongues till the holy rite was over.  Then the\\n    eager spectators gathered round the count, demanding\\n    an explanation.\\n\\n    \"Gladly would I give it if I could, but I only\\n    know that it was the whim of my timid Viola, and I\\n    yielded to it.  Now, my children, let the play end.\\n    Unmask and receive my blessing.\"\\n\\n    But neither bent the knee, for the young bridegroom\\n    replied in a tone that startled all listeners\\n    as the mask fell, disclosing the noble face of Ferdinand\\n    Devereux, the artist lover, and leaning on the\\n    breast where now flashed the star of an English earl\\n    was the lovely Viola, radiant with joy and beauty.\\n\\n    \"My lord, you scornfully bade me claim your\\n    daughter when I could boast as high a name and vast a\\n    fortune as the Count Antonio.  I can do more, for even\\n    your ambitious soul cannot refuse the Earl of Devereux\\n    and De Vere, when he gives his ancient name and boundless\\n    wealth in return for the beloved hand of this fair lady,\\n    now my wife.\"\\n\\n    The count stood like one changed to stone, and\\n    turning to the bewildered crowd, Ferdinand added, with\\n    a gay smile of triumph, \"To you, my gallant friends, I\\n    can only wish that your wooing may prosper as mine has\\n    done, and that you may all win as fair a bride as I have\\n    by this masked marriage.\"\\n    S.

One day in October,\\n    when they were ripe, he picked one and took it\\n    to market.  A grocerman bought and put it in his shop.\\n    That same morning, a little girl in a brown hat\\n    and blue dress, with a round face and snub nose, went\\n    and bought it for her mother.  She lugged it home, cut\\n    it up, and boiled it in the big pot, mashed some of it\\n    with salt and butter, for dinner.  And to the rest she added\\n    a pint of milk, two eggs, four spoons of sugar, nutmeg,\\n    and some crackers, put it in a deep dish, and baked it\\n    till it was brown and nice, and next day it was eaten\\n    by a family named March.\\n    T.

A perfect\\n    scene of ruin met our eyes, for in his fall Mr. Pickwick\\n    had plunged his head and shoulders into a tub of water,\\n    upset a keg of soft soap upon his manly form,  and torn\\n    his garments badly.  On being removed from this perilous\\n    situation, it was discovered that he had suffered\\n    no injury but several bruises, and we are happy to add,\\n    is now doing well.\\n    ED.\\n\\n    _________\\n\\n    THE PUBLIC BEREAVEMENT\\n\\n    It is our painful duty to record the sudden and\\n    mysterious disappearance of our cherished friend, Mrs.\\n    Snowball Pat Paw.

I propose Mr.\\nTheodore Laurence as an honorary member of the P.  C.  Come now, do\\nhave him.\"\\n\\nJo\\'s sudden change of tone made the girls laugh, but all looked rather\\nanxious, and no one said a word as Snodgrass took his seat.\\n\\n\"We\\'ll put it to a vote,\" said the President.  \"All in favor of this\\nmotion please to manifest it by saying, \\'Aye\\'.\"\\n\\nA loud response from Snodgrass, followed, to everybody\\'s surprise, by a\\ntimid one from Beth.\\n\\n\"Contrary-minded say, \\'No\\'.\"\\n\\nMeg and Amy were contrary-minded, and Mr. Winkle rose to say with great\\nelegance, \"We don\\'t wish any boys, they only joke and bounce about.\\nThis is a ladies\\' club, and we wish to be private and proper.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid he\\'ll laugh at our paper, and make fun of us afterward,\"\\nobserved Pickwick, pulling the little curl on her forehead, as she\\nalways did when doubtful.\\n\\nUp rose Snodgrass, very much in earnest.  \"Sir, I give you my word as a\\ngentleman, Laurie won\\'t do anything of the sort.  He likes to write,\\nand he\\'ll give a tone to our contributions and keep us from being\\nsentimental, don\\'t you see?  We can do so little for him, and he does\\nso much for us, I think the least we can do is to offer him a place\\nhere, and make him welcome if he comes.\"\\n\\nThis artful allusion to benefits conferred brought Tupman to his feet,\\nlooking as if he had quite made up his mind.\\n\\n\"Yes; we ought to do it, even if we are afraid.  I say he may come, and\\nhis grandpa, too, if he likes.\"\\n\\nThis spirited burst from Beth electrified the club, and Jo left her\\nseat to shake hands approvingly.  \"Now then, vote again. Everybody\\nremember it\\'s our Laurie, and say, \\'Aye!\\'\" cried Snodgrass excitedly.\\n\\n\"Aye!  Aye!  Aye!\" replied three voices at once.\\n\\n\"Good!  Bless you!  Now, as there\\'s nothing like \\'taking time by the\\nfetlock\\', as Winkle characteristically observes, allow me to present\\nthe new member.\"  And, to the dismay of the rest of the club, Jo threw\\nopen the door of the closet, and displayed Laurie sitting on a rag bag,\\nflushed and twinkling with suppressed laughter.\\n\\n\"You rogue!  You traitor!  Jo, how could you?\" cried the three girls,\\nas Snodgrass led her friend triumphantly forth, and producing both a\\nchair and a badge, installed him in a jiffy.\\n\\n\"The coolness of you two rascals is amazing,\" began Mr. Pickwick,\\ntrying to get up an awful frown and only succeeding in producing an\\namiable smile.  But the new member was equal to the occasion, and\\nrising, with a grateful salutation to the Chair, said in the most\\nengaging manner, \"Mr. President and ladies--I beg pardon,\\ngentlemen--allow me to introduce myself as Sam Weller, the very humble\\nservant of the club.\"\\n\\n\"Good!  Good!\" cried Jo, pounding with the handle of the old warming\\npan on which she leaned.\\n\\n\"My faithful friend and noble patron,\" continued Laurie with a wave of\\nthe hand, \"who has so flatteringly presented me, is not to be blamed\\nfor the base stratagem of tonight.  I planned it, and she only gave in\\nafter lots of teasing.\"\\n\\n\"Come now, don\\'t lay it all on yourself.  You know I proposed the\\ncupboard,\" broke in Snodgrass, who was enjoying the joke amazingly.\\n\\n\"Never mind what she says.  I\\'m the wretch that did it, sir,\" said the\\nnew member, with a Welleresque nod to Mr. Pickwick.  \"But on my honor,\\nI never will do so again, and henceforth devote myself to the interest\\nof this immortal club.\"\\n\\n\"Hear!  Hear!\" cried Jo, clashing the lid of the warming pan like a\\ncymbal.\\n\\n\"Go on, go on!\" added Winkle and Tupman, while the President bowed\\nbenignly.\\n\\n\"I merely wish to say, that as a slight token of my gratitude for the\\nhonor done me, and as a means of promoting friendly relations between\\nadjoining nations, I have set up a post office in the hedge in the\\nlower corner of the garden, a fine, spacious building with padlocks on\\nthe doors and every convenience for the mails, also the females, if I\\nmay be allowed the expression.  It\\'s the old martin house, but I\\'ve\\nstopped up the door and made the roof open, so it will hold all sorts\\nof things, and save our valuable time.  Letters, manuscripts, books,\\nand bundles can be passed in there, and as each nation has a key, it\\nwill be uncommonly nice, I fancy.  Allow me to present the club key,\\nand with many thanks for your favor, take my seat.\"\\n\\nGreat applause as Mr. Weller deposited a little key on the table and\\nsubsided, the warming pan clashed and waved wildly, and it was some\\ntime before order could be restored.  A long discussion followed, and\\neveryone came out surprising, for everyone did her best.  So it was an\\nunusually lively meeting, and did not adjourn till a late hour, when it\\nbroke up with three shrill cheers for the new member.\\n\\nNo one ever regretted the admittance of Sam Weller, for a more devoted,\\nwell-behaved, and jovial member no club could have. He certainly did\\nadd \\'spirit\\' to the meetings, and \\'a tone\\' to the paper, for his\\norations convulsed his hearers and his contributions were excellent,\\nbeing patriotic, classical, comical, or dramatic, but never\\nsentimental.  Jo regarded them as worthy of Bacon, Milton, or\\nShakespeare, and remodeled her own works with good effect, she thought.\\n\\nThe P.  O.  was a capital little institution, and flourished\\nwonderfully, for nearly as many queer things passed through it as\\nthrough the real post office.  Tragedies and cravats, poetry and\\npickles, garden seeds and long letters, music and gingerbread, rubbers,\\ninvitations, scoldings, and puppies.  The old gentleman liked the fun,\\nand amused himself by sending odd bundles, mysterious messages, and\\nfunny telegrams, and his gardener, who was smitten with Hannah\\'s\\ncharms, actually sent a love letter to Jo\\'s care.  How they laughed\\nwhen the secret came out, never dreaming how many love letters that\\nlittle post office would hold in the years to come.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'ELEVEN\\n\\nEXPERIMENTS\\n\\n\"The first of June!  The Kings are off to the seashore tomorrow, and\\nI\\'m free.  Three months\\' vacation--how I shall enjoy it!\" exclaimed\\nMeg, coming home one warm day to find Jo laid upon the sofa in an\\nunusual state of exhaustion, while Beth took off her dusty boots, and\\nAmy made lemonade for the refreshment of the whole party.\\n\\n\"Aunt March went today, for which, oh, be joyful!\" said Jo. \"I was\\nmortally afraid she\\'d ask me to go with her.  If she had, I should have\\nfelt as if I ought to do it, but Plumfield is about as gay as a\\nchurchyard, you know, and I\\'d rather be excused. We had a flurry\\ngetting the old lady off, and I had a fright every time she spoke to\\nme, for I was in such a hurry to be through that I was uncommonly\\nhelpful and sweet, and feared she\\'d find it impossible to part from me.\\nI quaked till she was fairly in the carriage, and had a final fright,\\nfor as it drove of, she popped out her head, saying, \\'Josyphine, won\\'t\\nyou--?\\' I didn\\'t hear any more, for I basely turned and fled.  I did\\nactually run, and whisked round the corner where I felt safe.\"\\n\\n\"Poor old Jo!  She came in looking as if bears were after her,\" said\\nBeth, as she cuddled her sister\\'s feet with a motherly air.\\n\\n\"Aunt March is a regular samphire, is she not?\" observed Amy, tasting\\nher mixture critically.\\n\\n\"She means vampire, not seaweed, but it doesn\\'t matter.  It\\'s too warm\\nto be particular about one\\'s parts of speech,\" murmured Jo.\\n\\n\"What shall you do all your vacation?\" asked Amy, changing the subject\\nwith tact.\\n\\n\"I shall lie abed late, and do nothing,\" replied Meg, from the depths\\nof the rocking chair.  \"I\\'ve been routed up early all winter and had to\\nspend my days working for other people, so now I\\'m going to rest and\\nrevel to my heart\\'s content.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Jo, \"that dozy way wouldn\\'t suit me.  I\\'ve laid in a heap of\\nbooks, and I\\'m going to improve my shining hours reading on my perch in\\nthe old apple tree, when I\\'m not having l----\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t say \\'larks!\\'\" implored Amy, as a return snub for the \\'samphire\\'\\ncorrection.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll say \\'nightingales\\' then, with Laurie.  That\\'s proper and\\nappropriate, since he\\'s a warbler.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t let us do any lessons, Beth, for a while, but play all the time\\nand rest, as the girls mean to,\" proposed Amy.\\n\\n\"Well, I will, if Mother doesn\\'t mind.  I want to learn some new songs,\\nand my children need fitting up for the summer.  They are dreadfully\\nout of order and really suffering for clothes.\"\\n\\n\"May we, Mother?\" asked Meg, turning to Mrs. March, who sat sewing in\\nwhat they called \\'Marmee\\'s corner\\'.\\n\\n\"You may try your experiment for a week and see how you like it.  I\\nthink by Saturday night you will find that all play and no work is as\\nbad as all work and no play.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, dear, no!  It will be delicious, I\\'m sure,\" said Meg complacently.\\n\\n\"I now propose a toast, as my \\'friend and pardner, Sairy Gamp\\', says.\\nFun forever, and no grubbing!\" cried Jo, rising, glass in hand, as the\\nlemonade went round.\\n\\nThey all drank it merrily, and began the experiment by lounging for the\\nrest of the day.  Next morning, Meg did not appear till ten o\\'clock.\\nHer solitary breakfast did not taste good, and the room seemed lonely\\nand untidy, for Jo had not filled the vases, Beth had not dusted, and\\nAmy\\'s books lay scattered about.  Nothing was neat and pleasant but\\n\\'Marmee\\'s corner\\', which looked as usual.  And there Meg sat, to \\'rest\\nand read\\', which meant to yawn and imagine what pretty summer dresses\\nshe would get with her salary.  Jo spent the morning on the river with\\nLaurie and the afternoon reading and crying over _The Wide, Wide\\nWorld_, up in the apple tree.  Beth began by rummaging everything out\\nof the big closet where her family resided, but getting tired before\\nhalf done, she left her establishment topsy-turvy and went to her\\nmusic, rejoicing that she had no dishes to wash. Amy arranged her\\nbower, put on her best white frock, smoothed her curls, and sat down to\\ndraw under the honeysuckle, hoping someone would see and inquire who\\nthe young artist was.  As no one appeared but an inquisitive\\ndaddy-longlegs, who examined her work with interest, she went to walk,\\ngot caught in a shower, and came home dripping.\\n\\nAt teatime they compared notes, and all agreed that it had been a\\ndelightful, though unusually long day.  Meg, who went shopping in the\\nafternoon and got a \\'sweet blue muslin\\', had discovered, after she had\\ncut the breadths off, that it wouldn\\'t wash, which mishap made her\\nslightly cross.  Jo had burned the skin off her nose boating, and got a\\nraging headache by reading too long.  Beth was worried by the confusion\\nof her closet and the difficulty of learning three or four songs at\\nonce, and Amy deeply regretted the damage done her frock, for Katy\\nBrown\\'s party was to be the next day and now like Flora McFlimsey, she\\nhad \\'nothing to wear\\'.  But these were mere trifles, and they assured\\ntheir mother that the experiment was working finely.  She smiled, said\\nnothing, and with Hannah\\'s help did their neglected work, keeping home\\npleasant and the domestic machinery running smoothly.  It was\\nastonishing what a peculiar and uncomfortable state of things was\\nproduced by the \\'resting and reveling\\' process.  The days kept getting\\nlonger and longer, the weather was unusually variable and so were\\ntempers; an unsettled feeling possessed everyone, and Satan found\\nplenty of mischief for the idle hands to do.  As the height of luxury,\\nMeg put out some of her sewing, and then found time hang so heavily,\\nthat she fell to snipping and spoiling her clothes in her attempts to\\nfurbish them up a la Moffat.  Jo read till her eyes gave out and she\\nwas sick of books, got so fidgety that even good-natured Laurie had a\\nquarrel with her, and so reduced in spirits that she desperately wished\\nshe had gone with Aunt March.  Beth got on pretty well, for she was\\nconstantly forgetting that it was to be all play and no work, and fell\\nback into her old ways now and then.  But something in the air affected\\nher, and more than once her tranquility was much disturbed, so much so\\nthat on one occasion she actually shook poor dear Joanna and told her\\nshe was \\'a fright\\'.  Amy fared worst of all, for her resources were\\nsmall, and when her sisters left her to amuse herself, she soon found\\nthat accomplished and important little self a great burden.  She didn\\'t\\nlike dolls, fairy tales were childish, and one couldn\\'t draw all the\\ntime.  Tea parties didn\\'t amount to much, neither did picnics, unless\\nvery well conducted.  \"If one could have a fine house, full of nice\\ngirls, or go traveling, the summer would be delightful, but to stay at\\nhome with three selfish sisters and a grown-up boy was enough to try\\nthe patience of a Boaz,\" complained Miss Malaprop, after several days\\ndevoted to pleasure, fretting, and ennui.\\n\\nNo one would own that they were tired of the experiment, but by Friday\\nnight each acknowledged to herself that she was glad the week was\\nnearly done.  Hoping to impress the lesson more deeply, Mrs. March, who\\nhad a good deal of humor, resolved to finish off the trial in an\\nappropriate manner, so she gave Hannah a holiday and let the girls\\nenjoy the full effect of the play system.\\n\\nWhen they got up on Saturday morning, there was no fire in the kitchen,\\nno breakfast in the dining room, and no mother anywhere to be seen.\\n\\n\"Mercy on us!  What has happened?\" cried Jo, staring about her in\\ndismay.\\n\\nMeg ran upstairs and soon came back again, looking relieved but rather\\nbewildered, and a little ashamed.\\n\\n\"Mother isn\\'t sick, only very tired, and she says she is going to stay\\nquietly in her room all day and let us do the best we can.  It\\'s a very\\nqueer thing for her to do, she doesn\\'t act a bit like herself.  But she\\nsays it has been a hard week for her, so we mustn\\'t grumble but take\\ncare of ourselves.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s easy enough, and I like the idea, I\\'m aching for something to\\ndo, that is, some new amusement, you know,\" added Jo quickly.\\n\\nIn fact it was an immense relief to them all to have a little work, and\\nthey took hold with a will, but soon realized the truth of Hannah\\'s\\nsaying, \"Housekeeping ain\\'t no joke.\"  There was plenty of food in the\\nlarder, and while Beth and Amy set the table, Meg and Jo got breakfast,\\nwondering as they did why servants ever talked about hard work.\\n\\n\"I shall take some up to Mother, though she said we were not to think\\nof her, for she\\'d take care of herself,\" said Meg, who presided and\\nfelt quite matronly behind the teapot.\\n\\nSo a tray was fitted out before anyone began, and taken up with the\\ncook\\'s compliments.  The boiled tea was very bitter, the omelet\\nscorched, and the biscuits speckled with saleratus, but Mrs. March\\nreceived her repast with thanks and laughed heartily over it after Jo\\nwas gone.\\n\\n\"Poor little souls, they will have a hard time, I\\'m afraid, but they\\nwon\\'t suffer, and it will do them good,\" she said, producing the more\\npalatable viands with which she had provided herself, and disposing of\\nthe bad breakfast, so that their feelings might not be hurt, a motherly\\nlittle deception for which they were grateful.\\n\\nMany were the complaints below, and great the chagrin of the head cook\\nat her failures.  \"Never mind, I\\'ll get the dinner and be servant, you\\nbe mistress, keep your hands nice, see company, and give orders,\" said\\nJo, who knew still less than Meg about culinary affairs.\\n\\nThis obliging offer was gladly accepted, and Margaret retired to the\\nparlor, which she hastily put in order by whisking the litter under the\\nsofa and shutting the blinds to save the trouble of dusting.  Jo, with\\nperfect faith in her own powers and a friendly desire to make up the\\nquarrel, immediately put a note in the office, inviting Laurie to\\ndinner.\\n\\n\"You\\'d better see what you have got before you think of having\\ncompany,\" said Meg, when informed of the hospitable but rash act.\\n\\n\"Oh, there\\'s corned beef and plenty of potatoes, and I shall get some\\nasparagus and a lobster, \\'for a relish\\', as Hannah says. We\\'ll have\\nlettuce and make a salad.  I don\\'t know how, but the book tells.  I\\'ll\\nhave blanc mange and strawberries for dessert, and coffee too, if you\\nwant to be elegant.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t try too many messes, Jo, for you can\\'t make anything but\\ngingerbread and molasses candy fit to eat.  I wash my hands of the\\ndinner party, and since you have asked Laurie on your own\\nresponsibility, you may just take care of him.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want you to do anything but be civil to him and help to the\\npudding.  You\\'ll give me your advice if I get in a muddle, won\\'t you?\"\\nasked Jo, rather hurt.\\n\\n\"Yes, but I don\\'t know much, except about bread and a few trifles.  You\\nhad better ask Mother\\'s leave before you order anything,\" returned Meg\\nprudently.\\n\\n\"Of course I shall.  I\\'m not a fool.\"  And Jo went off in a huff at the\\ndoubts expressed of her powers.\\n\\n\"Get what you like, and don\\'t disturb me.  I\\'m going out to dinner and\\ncan\\'t worry about things at home,\" said Mrs. March, when Jo spoke to\\nher.  \"I never enjoyed housekeeping, and I\\'m going to take a vacation\\ntoday, and read, write, go visiting, and amuse myself.\"\\n\\nThe unusual spectacle of her busy mother rocking comfortably and\\nreading early in the morning made Jo feel as if some unnatural\\nphenomenon had occurred, for an eclipse, an earthquake, or a volcanic\\neruption would hardly have seemed stranger.\\n\\n\"Everything is out of sorts, somehow,\" she said to herself, going\\ndownstairs.  \"There\\'s Beth crying, that\\'s a sure sign that something is\\nwrong in this family.  If Amy is bothering, I\\'ll shake her.\"\\n\\nFeeling very much out of sorts herself, Jo hurried into the parlor to\\nfind Beth sobbing over Pip, the canary, who lay dead in the cage with\\nhis little claws pathetically extended, as if imploring the food for\\nwant of which he had died.\\n\\n\"It\\'s all my fault, I forgot him, there isn\\'t a seed or a drop left.\\nOh, Pip!  Oh, Pip!  How could I be so cruel to you?\" cried Beth, taking\\nthe poor thing in her hands and trying to restore him.\\n\\nJo peeped into his half-open eye, felt his little heart, and finding\\nhim stiff and cold, shook her head, and offered her domino box for a\\ncoffin.\\n\\n\"Put him in the oven, and maybe he will get warm and revive,\" said Amy\\nhopefully.\\n\\n\"He\\'s been starved, and he shan\\'t be baked now he\\'s dead.  I\\'ll make\\nhim a shroud, and he shall be buried in the garden, and I\\'ll never have\\nanother bird, never, my Pip! for I am too bad to own one,\" murmured\\nBeth, sitting on the floor with her pet folded in her hands.\\n\\n\"The funeral shall be this afternoon, and we will all go.  Now, don\\'t\\ncry, Bethy.  It\\'s a pity, but nothing goes right this week, and Pip has\\nhad the worst of the experiment.  Make the shroud, and lay him in my\\nbox, and after the dinner party, we\\'ll have a nice little funeral,\"\\nsaid Jo, beginning to feel as if she had undertaken a good deal.\\n\\nLeaving the others to console Beth, she departed to the kitchen, which\\nwas in a most discouraging state of confusion.  Putting on a big apron,\\nshe fell to work and got the dishes piled up ready for washing, when\\nshe discovered that the fire was out.\\n\\n\"Here\\'s a sweet prospect!\" muttered Jo, slamming the stove door open,\\nand poking vigorously among the cinders.\\n\\nHaving rekindled the fire, she thought she would go to market while the\\nwater heated.  The walk revived her spirits, and flattering herself\\nthat she had made good bargains, she trudged home again, after buying a\\nvery young lobster, some very old asparagus, and two boxes of acid\\nstrawberries.  By the time she got cleared up, the dinner arrived and\\nthe stove was red-hot.  Hannah had left a pan of bread to rise, Meg had\\nworked it up early, set it on the hearth for a second rising, and\\nforgotten it.  Meg was entertaining Sallie Gardiner in the parlor, when\\nthe door flew open and a floury, crocky, flushed, and disheveled figure\\nappeared, demanding tartly...\\n\\n\"I say, isn\\'t bread \\'riz\\' enough when it runs over the pans?\"\\n\\nSallie began to laugh, but Meg nodded and lifted her eyebrows as high\\nas they would go, which caused the apparition to vanish and put the\\nsour bread into the oven without further delay.  Mrs. March went out,\\nafter peeping here and there to see how matters went, also saying a\\nword of comfort to Beth, who sat making a winding sheet, while the dear\\ndeparted lay in state in the domino box.  A straLanguage cannot describe\\nnge sense of\\nhelplessness fell upon the girls as the gray bonnet vanished round the\\ncorner, and despair seized them when a few minutes later Miss Crocker\\nappeared, and said she\\'d come to dinner.  Now this lady was a thin,\\nyellow spinster, with a sharp nose and inquisitive eyes, who saw\\neverything and gossiped about all she saw. They disliked her, but had\\nbeen taught to be kind to her, simply because she was old and poor and\\nhad few friends.  So Meg gave her the easy chair and tried to entertain\\nher, while she asked questions, criticized everything, and told stories\\nof the people whom she knew.\\n\\nLanguage cannot describe the anxieties, experiences, and exertions\\nwhich Jo underwent that morning, and the dinner she served up became a\\nstanding joke.  Fearing to ask any more advice, she did her best alone,\\nand discovered that something more than energy and good will is\\nnecessary to make a cook.  She boiled the asparagus for an hour and was\\ngrieved to find the heads cooked off and the stalks harder than ever.\\nThe bread burned black; for the salad dressing so aggravated her that\\nshe could not make it fit to eat.  The lobster was a scarlet mystery to\\nher, but she hammered and poked till it was unshelled and its meager\\nproportions concealed in a grove of lettuce leaves.  The potatoes had\\nto be hurried, not to keep the asparagus waiting, and were not done at\\nthe last.  The blanc mange was lumpy, and the strawberries not as ripe\\nas they looked, having been skilfully \\'deaconed\\'.\\n\\n\"Well, they can eat beef and bread and butter, if they are hungry, only\\nit\\'s mortifying to have to spend your whole morning for nothing,\"\\nthought Jo, as she rang the bell half an hour later than usual, and\\nstood, hot, tired, and dispirited, surveying the feast spread before\\nLaurie, accustomed to all sorts of elegance, and Miss Crocker, whose\\ntattling tongue would report them far and wide.\\n\\nPoor Jo would gladly have gone under the table, as one thing after\\nanother was tasted and left, while Amy giggled, Meg looked distressed,\\nMiss Crocker pursed her lips, and Laurie talked and laughed with all\\nhis might to give a cheerful tone to the festive scene.  Jo\\'s one\\nstrong point was the fruit, for she had sugared it well, and had a\\npitcher of rich cream to eat with it.  Her hot cheeks cooled a trifle,\\nand she drew a long breath as the pretty glass plates went round, and\\neveryone looked graciously at the little rosy islands floating in a sea\\nof cream.  Miss Crocker tasted first, made a wry face, and drank some\\nwater hastily.  Jo, who refused, thinking there might not be enough,\\nfor they dwindled sadly after the picking over, glanced at Laurie, but\\nhe was eating away manfully, though there was a slight pucker about his\\nmouth and he kept his eye fixed on his plate.  Amy, who was fond of\\ndelicate fare, took a heaping spoonful, choked, hid her face in her\\nnapkin, and left the table precipitately.\\n\\n\"Oh, what is it?\" exclaimed Jo, trembling.\\n\\n\"Salt instead of sugar, and the cream is sour,\" replied Meg with a\\ntragic gesture.\\n\\nJo uttered a groan and fell back in her chair, remembering that she had\\ngiven a last hasty powdering to the berries out of one of the two boxes\\non the kitchen table, and had neglected to put the milk in the\\nrefrigerator.  She turned scarlet and was on the verge of crying, when\\nshe met Laurie\\'s eyes, which would look merry in spite of his heroic\\nefforts.  The comical side of the affair suddenly struck her, and she\\nlaughed till the tears ran down her cheeks.  So did everyone else, even\\n\\'Croaker\\' as the girls called the old lady, and the unfortunate dinner\\nended gaily, with bread and butter, olives and fun.\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t strength of mind enough to clear up now, so we will sober\\nourselves with a funeral,\" said Jo, as they rose, and Miss Crocker made\\nready to go, being eager to tell the new story at another friend\\'s\\ndinner table.\\n\\nThey did sober themselves for Beth\\'s sake.  Laurie dug a grave under\\nthe ferns in the grove, little Pip was laid in, with many tears by his\\ntender-hearted mistress, and covered with moss, while a wreath of\\nviolets and chickweed was hung on the stone which bore his epitaph,\\ncomposed by Jo while she struggled with the dinner.\\n\\n    Here lies Pip March,\\n    Who died the 7th of June;\\n    Loved and lamented sore,\\n    And not forgotten soon.\\n\\nAt the conclusion of the ceremonies, Beth retired to her room, overcome\\nwith emotion and lobster, but there was no place of repose, for the\\nbeds were not made, and she found her grief much assuaged by beating up\\nthe pillows and putting things in order.  Meg helped Jo clear away the\\nremains of the feast, which took half the afternoon and left them so\\ntired that they agreed to be contented with tea and toast for supper.\\n\\nLaurie took Amy to drive, which was a deed of charity, for the sour\\ncream seemed to have had a bad effect upon her temper.  Mrs. March came\\nhome to find the three older girls hard at work in the middle of the\\nafternoon, and a glance at the closet gave her an idea of the success\\nof one part of the experiment.\\n\\nBefore the housewives could rest, several people called, and there was\\na scramble to get ready to see them.  Then tea must be got, errands\\ndone, and one or two necessary bits of sewing neglected until the last\\nminute.  As twilight fell, dewy and still, one by one they gathered on\\nthe porch where the June roses were budding beautifully, and each\\ngroaned or sighed as she sat down, as if tired or troubled.\\n\\n\"What a dreadful day this has been!\" began Jo, usually the first to\\nspeak.\\n\\n\"It has seemed shorter than usual, but so uncomfortable,\" said Meg.\\n\\n\"Not a bit like home,\" added Amy.\\n\\n\"It can\\'t seem so without Marmee and little Pip,\" sighed Beth, glancing\\nwith full eyes at the empty cage above her head.\\n\\n\"Here\\'s Mother, dear, and you shall have another bird tomorrow, if you\\nwant it.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke, Mrs. March came and took her place among them, looking as\\nif her holiday had not been much pleasanter than theirs.\\n\\n\"Are you satisfied with your experiment, girls, or do you want another\\nweek of it?\" she asked, as Beth nestled up to her and the rest turned\\ntoward her with brightening faces, as flowers turn toward the sun.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t!\" cried Jo decidedly.\\n\\n\"Nor I,\" echoed the others.\\n\\n\"You think then, that it is better to have a few duties and live a\\nlittle for others, do you?\"\\n\\n\"Lounging and larking doesn\\'t pay,\" observed Jo, shaking her head. \"I\\'m\\ntired of it and mean to go to work at something right off.\"\\n\\n\"Suppose you learn plain cooking.  That\\'s a useful accomplishment,\\nwhich no woman should be without,\" said Mrs. March, laughing inaudibly\\nat the recollection of Jo\\'s dinner party, for she had met Miss Crocker\\nand heard her account of it.\\n\\n\"Mother, did you go away and let everything be, just to see how we\\'d\\nget on?\" cried Meg, who had had suspicions all day.\\n\\n\"Yes, I wanted you to see how the comfort of all depends on each doing\\nher share faithfully.  While Hannah and I did your work, you got on\\npretty well, though I don\\'t think you were very happy or amiable.  So I\\nthought, as a little lesson, I would show you what happens when\\neveryone thinks only of herself.  Don\\'t you feel that it is pleasanter\\nto help one another, to have daily duties which make leisure sweet when\\nit comes, and to bear and forbear, that home may be comfortable and\\nlovely to us all?\"\\n\\n\"We do, Mother, we do!\" cried the girls.\\n\\n\"Then let me advise you to take up your little burdens again, for\\nthough they seem heavy sometimes, they are good for us, and lighten as\\nwe learn to carry them.  Work is wholesome, and there is plenty for\\neveryone.  It keeps us from ennui and mischief, is good for health and\\nspirits, and gives us a sense of power and independence better than\\nmoney or fashion.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll work like bees, and love it too, see if we don\\'t,\" said Jo.\\n\"I\\'ll learn plain cooking for my holiday task, and the next dinner\\nparty I have shall be a success.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll make the set of shirts for father, instead of letting you do it,\\nMarmee.  I can and I will, though I\\'m not fond of sewing. That will be\\nbetter than fussing over my own things, which are plenty nice enough as\\nthey are.\" said Meg.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll do my lessons every day, and not spend so much time with my music\\nand dolls.  I am a stupid thing, and ought to be studying, not\\nplaying,\" was Beth\\'s resolution, while Amy followed their example by\\nheroically declaring, \"I shall learn to make buttonholes, and attend to\\nmy parts of speech.\"\\n\\n\"Very good!  Then I am quite satisfied with the experiment, and fancy\\nthat we shall not have to repeat it, only don\\'t go to the other extreme\\nand delve like slaves.  Have regular hours for work and play, make each\\nday both useful and pleasant, and prove that you understand the worth\\nof time by employing it well.  Then youth will be delightful, old age\\nwill bring few regrets, and life become a beautiful success, in spite\\nof poverty.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll remember, Mother!\" and they did.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'TWELVE\\n\\nCAMP LAURENCE\\n\\nBeth was postmistress, for, being most at home, she could attend to it\\nregularly, and dearly liked the daily task of unlocking the little door\\nand distributing the mail.  One July day she came in with her hands\\nfull, and went about the house leaving letters and parcels like the\\npenny post.\\n\\n\"Here\\'s your posy, Mother!  Laurie never forgets that,\" she said,\\nputting the fresh nosegay in the vase that stood in \\'Marmee\\'s corner\\',\\nand was kept supplied by the affectionate boy.\\n\\n\"Miss Meg March, one letter and a glove,\" continued Beth, delivering\\nthe articles to her sister, who sat near her mother, stitching\\nwristbands.\\n\\n\"Why, I left a pair over there, and here is only one,\" said Meg,\\nlooking at the gray cotton glove.  \"Didn\\'t you drop the other in the\\ngarden?\"\\n\\n\"No, I\\'m sure I didn\\'t, for there was only one in the office.\"\\n\\n\"I hate to have odd gloves!  Never mind, the other may be found.  My\\nletter is only a translation of the German song I wanted.  I think Mr.\\nBrooke did it, for this isn\\'t Laurie\\'s writing.\"\\n\\nMrs. March glanced at Meg, who was looking very pretty in her gingham\\nmorning gown, with the little curls blowing about her forehead, and\\nvery womanly, as she sat sewing at her little worktable, full of tidy\\nwhite rolls, so unconscious of the thought in her mother\\'s mind as she\\nsewed and sang, while her fingers flew and her thoughts were busied\\nwith girlish fancies as innocent and fresh as the pansies in her belt,\\nthat Mrs. March smiled and was satisfied.\\n\\n\"Two letters for Doctor Jo, a book, and a funny old hat, which covered\\nthe whole post office and stuck outside,\" said Beth, laughing as she\\nwent into the study where Jo sat writing.\\n\\n\"What a sly fellow Laurie is!  I said I wished bigger hats were the\\nfashion, because I burn my face every hot day.  He said, \\'Why mind the\\nfashion?  Wear a big hat, and be comfortable!\\' I said I would if I had\\none, and he has sent me this, to try me.  I\\'ll wear it for fun, and\\nshow him I don\\'t care for the fashion.\"  And hanging the antique\\nbroad-brim on a bust of Plato, Jo read her letters.\\n\\nOne from her mother made her cheeks glow and her eyes fill, for it said\\nto her...\\n\\n\\nMy Dear:\\n\\nI write a little word to tell you with how much satisfaction I watch\\nyour efforts to control your temper.  You say nothing about your\\ntrials, failures, or successes, and think, perhaps, that no one sees\\nthem but the Friend whose help you daily ask, if I may trust the\\nwell-worn cover of your guidebook.  I, too, have seen them all, and\\nheartily believe in the sincerity of your resolution, since it begins\\nto bear fruit.  Go on, dear, patiently and bravely, and always believe\\nthat no one sympathizes more tenderly with you than your loving...\\n\\nMother\\n\\n\\n\"That does me good!  That\\'s worth millions of money and pecks of\\npraise.  Oh, Marmee, I do try!  I will keep on trying, and not get\\ntired, since I have you to help me.\"\\n\\nLaying her head on her arms, Jo wet her little romance with a few happy\\ntears, for she had thought that no one saw and appreciated her efforts\\nto be good, and this assurance was doubly precious, doubly encouraging,\\nbecause unexpected and from the person whose commendation she most\\nvalued.  Feeling stronger than ever to meet and subdue her Apollyon,\\nshe pinned the note inside her frock, as a shield and a reminder, lest\\nshe be taken unaware, and proceeded to open her other letter, quite\\nready for either good or bad news.  In a big, dashing hand, Laurie\\nwrote...\\n\\nDear Jo, What ho!\\n\\nSome English girls and boys are coming to see me tomorrow and I want to\\nhave a jolly time.  If it\\'s fine, I\\'m going to pitch my tent in\\nLongmeadow, and row up the whole crew to lunch and croquet--have a\\nfire, make messes, gypsy fashion, and all sorts of larks.  They are\\nnice people, and like such things.  Brooke will go to keep us boys\\nsteady, and Kate Vaughn will play propriety for the girls.  I want you\\nall to come, can\\'t let Beth off at any price, and nobody shall worry\\nher.  Don\\'t bother about rations, I\\'ll see to that and everything else,\\nonly do come, there\\'s a good fellow!\\n\\nIn a tearing hurry, Yours ever, Laurie.\\n\\n\"Here\\'s richness!\" cried Jo, flying in to tell the news to Meg.\\n\\n\"Of course we can go, Mother?  It will be such a help to Laurie, for I\\ncan row, and Meg see to the lunch, and the children be useful in some\\nway.\"\\n\\n\"I hope the Vaughns are not fine grown-up people.  Do you know anything\\nabout them, Jo?\" asked Meg.\\n\\n\"Only that there are four of them.  Kate is older than you, Fred and\\nFrank (twins) about my age, and a little girl (Grace), who is nine or\\nten.  Laurie knew them abroad, and liked the boys.  I fancied, from the\\nway he primmed up his mouth in speaking of her, that he didn\\'t admire\\nKate much.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m so glad my French print is clean, it\\'s just the thing and so\\nbecoming!\" observed Meg complacently.  \"Have you anything decent, Jo?\"\\n\\n\"Scarlet and gray boating suit, good enough for me.  I shall row and\\ntramp about, so I don\\'t want any starch to think of.  You\\'ll come,\\nBetty?\"\\n\\n\"If you won\\'t let any boys talk to me.\"\\n\\n\"Not a boy!\"\\n\\n\"I like to please Laurie, and I\\'m not afraid of Mr. Brooke, he is so\\nkind.  But I don\\'t want to play, or sing, or say anything. I\\'ll work\\nhard and not trouble anyone, and you\\'ll take care of me, Jo, so I\\'ll\\ngo.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s my good girl.  You do try to fight off your shyness, and I love\\nyou for it.  Fighting faults isn\\'t easy, as I know, and a cheery word\\nkind of gives a lift.  Thank you, Mother,\" And Jo gave the thin cheek a\\ngrateful kiss, more precious to Mrs. March than if it had given back\\nthe rosy roundness of her youth.\\n\\n\"I had a box of chocolate drops, and the picture I wanted to copy,\"\\nsaid Amy, showing her mail.\\n\\n\"And I got a note from Mr. Laurence, asking me to come over and play to\\nhim tonight, before the lamps are lighted, and I shall go,\" added Beth,\\nwhose friendship with the old gentleman prospered finely.\\n\\n\"Now let\\'s fly round, and do double duty today, so that we can play\\ntomorrow with free minds,\" said Jo, preparing to replace her pen with a\\nbroom.\\n\\nWhen the sun peeped into the girls\\' room early next morning to promise\\nthem a fine day, he saw a comical sight.  Each had made such\\npreparation for the fete as seemed necessary and proper. Meg had an\\nextra row of little curlpapers across her forehead, Jo had copiously\\nanointed her afflicted face with cold cream, Beth had taken Joanna to\\nbed with her to atone for the approaching separation, and Amy had\\ncapped the climax by putting a clothespin on her nose to uplift the\\noffending feature.  It was one of the kind artists use to hold the\\npaper on their drawing boards, therefore quite appropriate and\\neffective for the purpose it was now being put.  This funny spectacle\\nappeared to amuse the sun, for he burst out with such radiance that Jo\\nwoke up and roused her sisters by a hearty laugh at Amy\\'s ornament.\\n\\nSunshine and laughter were good omens for a pleasure party, and soon a\\nlively bustle began in both houses.  Beth, who was ready first, kept\\nreporting what went on next door, and enlivened her sisters\\' toilets by\\nfrequent telegrams from the window.\\n\\n\"There goes the man with the tent!  I see Mrs. Barker doing up the\\nlunch in a hamper and a great basket.  Now Mr. Laurence is looking up\\nat the sky and the weathercock.  I wish he would go too.  There\\'s\\nLaurie, looking like a sailor, nice boy!  Oh, mercy me!  Here\\'s a\\ncarriage full of people, a tall lady, a little girl, and two dreadful\\nboys.  One is lame, poor thing, he\\'s got a crutch. Laurie didn\\'t tell\\nus that.  Be quick, girls!  It\\'s getting late. Why, there is Ned\\nMoffat, I do declare.  Meg, isn\\'t that the man who bowed to you one day\\nwhen we were shopping?\"\\n\\n\"So it is.  How queer that he should come.  I thought he was at the\\nmountains.  There is Sallie.  I\\'m glad she got back in time. Am I all\\nright, Jo?\" cried Meg in a flutter.\\n\\n\"A regular daisy.  Hold up your dress and put your hat on straight, it\\nlooks sentimental tipped that way and will fly off at the first puff.\\nNow then, come on!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Jo, you are not going to wear that awful hat?  It\\'s too absurd!\\nYou shall not make a guy of yourself,\" remonstrated Meg, as Jo tied\\ndown with a red ribbon the broad-brimmed, old-fashioned leghorn Laurie\\nhad sent for a joke.\\n\\n\"I just will, though, for it\\'s capital, so shady, light, and big. It\\nwill make fun, and I don\\'t mind being a guy if I\\'m comfortable.\" With\\nthat Jo marched straight away and the rest followed, a bright little\\nband of sisters, all looking their best in summer suits, with happy\\nfaces under the jaunty hatbrims.\\n\\nLaurie ran to meet and present them to his friends in the most cordial\\nmanner.  The lawn was the reception room, and for several minutes a\\nlively scene was enacted there.  Meg was grateful to see that Miss\\nKate, though twenty, was dressed with a simplicity which American girls\\nwould do well to imitate, and who was much flattered by Mr. Ned\\'s\\nassurances that he came especially to see her.  Jo understood why\\nLaurie \\'primmed up his mouth\\' when speaking of Kate, for that young\\nlady had a standoff-don\\'t-touch-me air, which contrasted strongly with\\nthe free and easy demeanor of the other girls.  Beth took an\\nobservation of the new boys and decided that the lame one was not\\n\\'dreadful\\', but gentle and feeble, and she would be kind to him on that\\naccount.  Amy found Grace a well-mannered, merry, little person, and\\nafter staring dumbly at one another for a few minutes, they suddenly\\nbecame very good friends.\\n\\nTents, lunch, and croquet utensils having been sent on beforehand, the\\nparty was soon embarked, and the two boats pushed off together, leaving\\nMr. Laurence waving his hat on the shore.  Laurie and Jo rowed one\\nboat, Mr. Brooke and Ned the other, while Fred Vaughn, the riotous\\ntwin, did his best to upset both by paddling about in a wherry like a\\ndisturbed water bug.  Jo\\'s funny hat deserved a vote of thanks, for it\\nwas of general utility.  It broke the ice in the beginning by producing\\na laugh, it created quite a refreshing breeze, flapping to and fro as\\nshe rowed, and would make an excellent umbrella for the whole party, if\\na shower came up, she said.  Miss Kate decided that she was \\'odd\\', but\\nrather clever, and smiled upon her from afar.\\n\\nMeg, in the other boat, was delightfully situated, face to face with\\nthe rowers, who both admired the prospect and feathered their oars with\\nuncommon \\'skill and dexterity\\'.  Mr. Brooke was a grave, silent young\\nman, with handsome brown eyes and a pleasant voice.  Meg liked his\\nquiet manners and considered him a walking encyclopedia of useful\\nknowledge.  He never talked to her much, but he looked at her a good\\ndeal, and she felt sure that he did not regard her with aversion.  Ned,\\nbeing in college, of course put on all the airs which freshmen think it\\ntheir bounden duty to assume.  He was not very wise, but very\\ngood-natured, and altogether an excellent person to carry on a picnic.\\nSallie Gardiner was absorbed in keeping her white pique dress clean and\\nchattering with the ubiquitous Fred, who kept Beth in constant terror\\nby his pranks.\\n\\nIt was not far to Longmeadow, but the tent was pitched and the wickets\\ndown by the time they arrived.  A pleasant green field, with three\\nwide-spreading oaks in the middle and a smooth strip of turf for\\ncroquet.\\n\\n\"Welcome to Camp Laurence!\" said the young host, as they landed with\\nexclamations of delight.\\n\\n\"Brooke is commander in chief, I am commissary general, the other\\nfellows are staff officers, and you, ladies, are company. The tent is\\nfor your especial benefit and that oak is your drawing room, this is\\nthe messroom and the third is the camp kitchen.  Now, let\\'s have a game\\nbefore it gets hot, and then we\\'ll see about dinner.\"\\n\\nFrank, Beth, Amy, and Grace sat down to watch the game played by the\\nother eight.  Mr. Brooke chose Meg, Kate, and Fred. Laurie took Sallie,\\nJo, and Ned.  The English played well, but the Americans played better,\\nand contested every inch of the ground as strongly as if the spirit of\\n\\'76 inspired them.  Jo and Fred had several skirmishes and once\\nnarrowly escaped high words. Jo was through the last wicket and had\\nmissed the stroke, which failure ruffled her a good deal.  Fred was\\nclose behind her and his turn came before hers.  He gave a stroke, his\\nball hit the wicket, and stopped an inch on the wrong side.  No one was\\nvery near, and running up to examine, he gave it a sly nudge with his\\ntoe, which put it just an inch on the right side.\\n\\n\"I\\'m through!  Now, Miss Jo, I\\'ll settle you, and get in first,\" cried\\nthe young gentleman, swinging his mallet for another blow.\\n\\n\"You pushed it.  I saw you.  It\\'s my turn now,\" said Jo sharply.\\n\\n\"Upon my word, I didn\\'t move it.  It rolled a bit, perhaps, but that is\\nallowed.  So, stand off please, and let me have a go at the stake.\"\\n\\n\"We don\\'t cheat in America, but you can, if you choose,\" said Jo\\nangrily.\\n\\n\"Yankees are a deal the most tricky, everybody knows.  There you go!\"\\nreturned Fred, croqueting her ball far away.\\n\\nJo opened her lips to say something rude, but checked herself in time,\\ncolored up to her forehead and stood a minute, hammering down a wicket\\nwith all her might, while Fred hit the stake and declared himself out\\nwith much exultation.  She went off to get her ball, and was a long\\ntime finding it among the bushes, but she came back, looking cool and\\nquiet, and waited her turn patiently.  It took several strokes to\\nregain the place she had lost, and when she got there, the other side\\nhad nearly won, for Kate\\'s ball was the last but one and lay near the\\nstake.\\n\\n\"By George, it\\'s all up with us!  Goodbye, Kate.  Miss Jo owes me one,\\nso you are finished,\" cried Fred excitedly, as they all drew near to\\nsee the finish.\\n\\n\"Yankees have a trick of being generous to their enemies,\" said Jo,\\nwith a look that made the lad redden, \"especially when they beat them,\"\\nshe added, as, leaving Kate\\'s ball untouched, she won the game by a\\nclever stroke.\\n\\nLaurie threw up his hat, then remembered that it wouldn\\'t do to exult\\nover the defeat of his guests, and stopped in the middle of the cheer\\nto whisper to his friend, \"Good for you, Jo!  He did cheat, I saw him.\\nWe can\\'t tell him so, but he won\\'t do it again, take my word for it.\"\\n\\nMeg drew her aside, under pretense of pinning up a loose braid, and\\nsaid approvingly, \"It was dreadfully provoking, but you kept your\\ntemper, and I\\'m so glad, Jo.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t praise me, Meg, for I could box his ears this minute. I should\\ncertainly have boiled over if I hadn\\'t stayed among the nettles till I\\ngot my rage under control enough to hold my tongue. It\\'s simmering now,\\nso I hope he\\'ll keep out of my way,\" returned Jo, biting her lips as\\nshe glowered at Fred from under her big hat.\\n\\n\"Time for lunch,\" said Mr. Brooke, looking at his watch. \"Commissary\\ngeneral, will you make the fire and get water, while Miss March, Miss\\nSallie, and I spread the table?  Who can make good coffee?\"\\n\\n\"Jo can,\" said Meg, glad to recommend her sister.  So Jo, feeling that\\nher late lessons in cookery were to do her honor, went to preside over\\nthe coffeepot, while the children collected dry sticks, and the boys\\nmade a fire and got water from a spring near by.  Miss Kate sketched\\nand Frank talked to Beth, who was making little mats of braided rushes\\nto serve as plates.\\n\\nThe commander in chief and his aides soon spread the tablecloth with an\\ninviting array of eatables and drinkables, prettily decorated with\\ngreen leaves.  Jo announced that the coffee was ready, and everyone\\nsettled themselves to a hearty meal, for youth is seldom dyspeptic, and\\nexercise develops wholesome appetites. A very merry lunch it was, for\\neverything seemed fresh and funny, and frequent peals of laughter\\nstartled a venerable horse who fed near by.  There was a pleasing\\ninequality in the table, which produced many mishaps to cups and\\nplates, acorns dropped in the milk, little black ants partook of the\\nrefreshments without being invited, and fuzzy caterpillars swung down\\nfrom the tree to see what was going on.  Three white-headed children\\npeeped over the fence, and an objectionable dog barked at them from the\\nother side of the river with all his might and main.\\n\\n\"There\\'s salt here,\" said Laurie, as he handed Jo a saucer of berries.\\n\\n\"Thank you, I prefer spiders,\" she replied, fishing up two unwary\\nlittle ones who had gone to a creamy death.  \"How dare you remind me of\\nthat horrid dinner party, when yours is so nice in every way?\" added\\nJo, as they both laughed and ate out of one plate, the china having run\\nshort.\\n\\n\"I had an uncommonly good time that day, and haven\\'t got over it yet.\\nThis is no credit to me, you know, I don\\'t do anything.  It\\'s you and\\nMeg and Brooke who make it all go, and I\\'m no end obliged to you.  What\\nshall we do when we can\\'t eat anymore?\" asked Laurie, feeling that his\\ntrump card had been played when lunch was over.\\n\\n\"Have games till it\\'s cooler.  I brought Authors, and I dare say Miss\\nKate knows something new and nice.  Go and ask her.  She\\'s company, and\\nyou ought to stay with her more.\"\\n\\n\"Aren\\'t you company too?  I thought she\\'d suit Brooke, but he keeps\\ntalking to Meg, and Kate just stares at them through that ridiculous\\nglass of hers.  I\\'m going, so you needn\\'t try to preach propriety, for\\nyou can\\'t do it, Jo.\"\\n\\nMiss Kate did know several new games, and as the girls would not, and\\nthe boys could not, eat any more, they all adjourned to the drawing\\nroom to play Rig-marole.\\n\\n\"One person begins a story, any nonsense you like, and tells as long as\\nhe pleases, only taking care to stop short at some exciting point, when\\nthe next takes it up and does the same.  It\\'s very funny when well\\ndone, and makes a perfect jumble of tragical comical stuff to laugh\\nover.  Please start it, Mr. Brooke,\" said Kate, with a commanding air,\\nwhich surprised Meg, who treated the tutor with as much respect as any\\nother gentleman.\\n\\nLying on the grass at the feet of the two young ladies, Mr. Brooke\\nobediently began the story, with the handsome brown eyes steadily fixed\\nupon the sunshiny river.\\n\\n\"Once on a time, a knight went out into the world to seek his fortune,\\nfor he had nothing but his sword and his shield. He traveled a long\\nwhile, nearly eight-and-twenty years, and had a hard time of it, till\\nhe came to the palace of a good old king, who had offered a reward to\\nanyone who could tame and train a fine but unbroken colt, of which he\\nwas very fond.  The knight agreed to try, and got on slowly but surely,\\nfor the colt was a gallant fellow, and soon learned to love his new\\nmaster, though he was freakish and wild.  Every day, when he gave his\\nlessons to this pet of the king\\'s, the knight rode him through the\\ncity, and as he rode, he looked everywhere for a certain beautiful\\nface, which he had seen many times in his dreams, but never found.  One\\nday, as he went prancing down a quiet street, he saw at the window of a\\nruinous castle the lovely face.  He was delighted, inquired who lived\\nin this old castle, and was told that several captive princesses were\\nkept there by a spell, and spun all day to lay up money to buy their\\nliberty.  The knight wished intensely that he could free them, but he\\nwas poor and could only go by each day, watching for the sweet face and\\nlonging to see it out in the sunshine.  At last he resolved to get into\\nthe castle and ask how he could help them.  He went and knocked.  The\\ngreat door flew open, and he beheld...\"\\n\\n\"A ravishingly lovely lady, who exclaimed, with a cry of rapture, \\'At\\nlast!  At last!\\'\" continued Kate, who had read French novels, and\\nadmired the style.  \"\\'Tis she!\\' cried Count Gustave, and fell at her\\nfeet in an ecstasy of joy.  \\'Oh, rise!\\' she said, extending a hand of\\nmarble fairness.  \\'Never! Till you tell me how I may rescue you,\\' swore\\nthe knight, still kneeling. \\'Alas, my cruel fate condemns me to remain\\nhere till my tyrant is destroyed.\\' \\'Where is the villain?\\' \\'In the\\nmauve salon.  Go, brave heart, and save me from despair.\\' \\'I obey, and\\nreturn victorious or dead!\\' With these thrilling words he rushed away,\\nand flinging open the door of the mauve salon, was about to enter, when\\nhe received...\"\\n\\n\"A stunning blow from the big Greek lexicon, which an old fellow in a\\nblack gown fired at him,\" said Ned.  \"Instantly, Sir What\\'s-his-name\\nrecovered himself, pitched the tyrant out of the window, and turned to\\njoin the lady, victorious, but with a bump on his brow, found the door\\nlocked, tore up the curtains, made a rope ladder, got halfway down when\\nthe ladder broke, and he went headfirst into the moat, sixty feet\\nbelow.  Could swim like a duck, paddled round the castle till he came\\nto a little door guarded by two stout fellows, knocked their heads\\ntogether till they cracked like a couple of nuts, then, by a trifling\\nexertion of his prodigious strength, he smashed in the door, went up a\\npair of stone steps covered with dust a foot thick, toads as big as\\nyour fist, and spiders that would frighten you into hysterics, Miss\\nMarch.  At the top of these steps he came plump upon a sight that took\\nhis breath away and chilled his blood...\"\\n\\n\"A tall figure, all in white with a veil over its face and a lamp in\\nits wasted hand,\" went on Meg.  \"It beckoned, gliding noiselessly\\nbefore him down a corridor as dark and cold as any tomb.  Shadowy\\neffigies in armor stood on either side, a dead silence reigned, the\\nlamp burned blue, and the ghostly figure ever and anon turned its face\\ntoward him, showing the glitter of awful eyes through its white veil.\\nThey reached a curtained door, behind which sounded lovely music.  He\\nsprang forward to enter, but the specter plucked him back, and waved\\nthreateningly before him a...\"\\n\\n\"Snuffbox,\" said Jo, in a sepulchral tone, which convulsed the\\naudience.  \"\\'Thankee,\\' said the knight politely, as he took a pinch and\\nsneezed seven times so violently that his head fell off.  \\'Ha! Ha!\\'\\nlaughed the ghost, and having peeped through the keyhole at the\\nprincesses spinning away for dear life, the evil spirit picked up her\\nvictim and put him in a large tin box, where there were eleven other\\nknights packed together without their heads, like sardines, who all\\nrose and began to...\"\\n\\n\"Dance a hornpipe,\" cut in Fred, as Jo paused for breath, \"and, as they\\ndanced, the rubbishy old castle turned to a man-of-war in full sail.\\n\\'Up with the jib, reef the tops\\'l halliards, helm hard alee, and man\\nthe guns!\\' roared the captain, as a Portuguese pirate hove in sight,\\nwith a flag black as ink flying from her foremast. \\'Go in and win, my\\nhearties!\\' says the captain, and a tremendous fight began.  Of course\\nthe British beat--they always do.\"\\n\\n\"No, they don\\'t!\" cried Jo, aside.\\n\\n\"Having taken the pirate captain prisoner, sailed slap over the\\nschooner, whose decks were piled high with dead and whose lee scuppers\\nran blood, for the order had been \\'Cutlasses, and die hard!\\' \\'Bosun\\'s\\nmate, take a bight of the flying-jib sheet, and start this villain if\\nhe doesn\\'t confess his sins double quick,\\' said the British captain.\\nThe Portuguese held his tongue like a brick, and walked the plank,\\nwhile the jolly tars cheered like mad.  But the sly dog dived, came up\\nunder the man-of-war, scuttled her, and down she went, with all sail\\nset, \\'To the bottom of the sea, sea, sea\\' where...\"\\n\\n\"Oh, gracious!  What shall I say?\" cried Sallie, as Fred ended his\\nrigmarole, in which he had jumbled together pell-mell nautical phrases\\nand facts out of one of his favorite books. \"Well, they went to the\\nbottom, and a nice mermaid welcomed them, but was much grieved on\\nfinding the box of headless knights, and kindly pickled them in brine,\\nhoping to discover the mystery about them, for being a woman, she was\\ncurious.  By-and-by a diver came down, and the mermaid said, \\'I\\'ll give\\nyou a box of pearls if you can take it up,\\' for she wanted to restore\\nthe poor things to life, and couldn\\'t raise the heavy load herself.  So\\nthe diver hoisted it up, and was much disappointed on opening it to\\nfind no pearls.  He left it in a great lonely field, where it was found\\nby a...\"\\n\\n\"Little goose girl, who kept a hundred fat geese in the field,\" said\\nAmy, when Sallie\\'s invention gave out.  \"The little girl was sorry for\\nthem, and asked an old woman what she should do to help them.  \\'Your\\ngeese will tell you, they know everything.\\' said the old woman.  So she\\nasked what she should use for new heads, since the old ones were lost,\\nand all the geese opened their hundred mouths and screamed...\"\\n\\n\"\\'Cabbages!\\'\" continued Laurie promptly.  \"\\'Just the thing,\\' said the\\ngirl, and ran to get twelve fine ones from her garden. She put them on,\\nthe knights revived at once, thanked her, and went on their way\\nrejoicing, never knowing the difference, for there were so many other\\nheads like them in the world that no one thought anything of it.  The\\nknight in whom I\\'m interested went back to find the pretty face, and\\nlearned that the princesses had spun themselves free and all gone and\\nmarried, but one.  He was in a great state of mind at that, and\\nmounting the colt, who stood by him through thick and thin, rushed to\\nthe castle to see which was left.  Peeping over the hedge, he saw the\\nqueen of his affections picking flowers in her garden.  \\'Will you give\\nme a rose?\\' said he.  \\'You must come and get it.  I can\\'t come to you,\\nit isn\\'t proper,\\' said she, as sweet as honey.  He tried to climb over\\nthe hedge, but it seemed to grow higher and higher.  Then he tried to\\npush through, but it grew thicker and thicker, and he was in despair.\\nSo he patiently broke twig after twig till he had made a little hole\\nthrough which he peeped, saying imploringly, \\'Let me in!  Let me in!\\'\\nBut the pretty princess did not seem to understand, for she picked her\\nroses quietly, and left him to fight his way in.  Whether he did or\\nnot, Frank will tell you.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t.  I\\'m not playing, I never do,\" said Frank, dismayed at the\\nsentimental predicament out of which he was to rescue the absurd\\ncouple.  Beth had disappeared behind Jo, and Grace was asleep.\\n\\n\"So the poor knight is to be left sticking in the hedge, is he?\" asked\\nMr. Brooke, still watching the river, and playing with the wild rose in\\nhis buttonhole.\\n\\n\"I guess the princess gave him a posy, and opened the gate after a\\nwhile,\" said Laurie, smiling to himself, as he threw acorns at his\\ntutor.\\n\\n\"What a piece of nonsense we have made!  With practice we might do\\nsomething quite clever.  Do you know Truth?\"\\n\\n\"I hope so,\" said Meg soberly.\\n\\n\"The game, I mean?\"\\n\\n\"What is it?\" said Fred.\\n\\n\"Why, you pile up your hands, choose a number, and draw out in turn,\\nand the person who draws at the number has to answer truly any question\\nput by the rest.  It\\'s great fun.\"\\n\\n\"Let\\'s try it,\" said Jo, who liked new experiments.\\n\\nMiss Kate and Mr. Brooke, Meg, and Ned declined, but Fred, Sallie, Jo,\\nand Laurie piled and drew, and the lot fell to Laurie.\\n\\n\"Who are your heroes?\" asked Jo.\\n\\n\"Grandfather and Napoleon.\"\\n\\n\"Which lady here do you think prettiest?\" said Sallie.\\n\\n\"Margaret.\"\\n\\n\"Which do you like best?\" from Fred.\\n\\n\"Jo, of course.\"\\n\\n\"What silly questions you ask!\"  And Jo gave a disdainful shrug as the\\nrest laughed at Laurie\\'s matter-of-fact tone.\\n\\n\"Try again.  Truth isn\\'t a bad game,\" said Fred.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a very good one for you,\" retorted Jo in a low voice. Her turn\\ncame next.\\n\\n\"What is your greatest fault?\" asked Fred, by way of testing in her the\\nvirtue he lacked himself.\\n\\n\"A quick temper.\"\\n\\n\"What do you most wish for?\" said Laurie.\\n\\n\"A pair of boot lacings,\" returned Jo, guessing and defeating his\\npurpose.\\n\\n\"Not a true answer.  You must say what you really do want most.\"\\n\\n\"Genius.  Don\\'t you wish you could give it to me, Laurie?\" And she\\nslyly smiled in his disappointed face.\\n\\n\"What virtues do you most admire in a man?\" asked Sallie.\\n\\n\"Courage and honesty.\"\\n\\n\"Now my turn,\" said Fred, as his hand came last.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s give it to him,\" whispered Laurie to Jo, who nodded and asked at\\nonce...\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t you cheat at croquet?\"\\n\\n\"Well, yes, a little bit.\"\\n\\n\"Good!  Didn\\'t you take your story out of _The Sea Lion?_\" said Laurie.\\n\\n\"Rather.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you think the English nation perfect in every respect?\" asked\\nSallie.\\n\\n\"I should be ashamed of myself if I didn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s a true John Bull.  Now, Miss Sallie, you shall have a chance\\nwithout waiting to draw.  I\\'ll harrrow up your feelings first by asking\\nif you don\\'t think you are something of a flirt,\" said Laurie, as Jo\\nnodded to Fred as a sign that peace was declared.\\n\\n\"You impertinent boy!  Of course I\\'m not,\" exclaimed Sallie, with an\\nair that proved the contrary.\\n\\n\"What do you hate most?\" asked Fred.\\n\\n\"Spiders and rice pudding.\"\\n\\n\"What do you like best?\" asked Jo.\\n\\n\"Dancing and French gloves.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I think Truth is a very silly play.  Let\\'s have a sensible game\\nof Authors to refresh our minds,\" proposed Jo.\\n\\nNed, Frank, and the little girls joined in this, and while it went on,\\nthe three elders sat apart, talking.  Miss Kate took out her sketch\\nagain, and Margaret watched her, while Mr. Brooke lay on the grass with\\na book, which he did not read.\\n\\n\"How beautifully you do it!  I wish I could draw,\" said Meg, with\\nmingled admiration and regret in her voice.\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you learn?  I should think you had taste and talent for it,\"\\nreplied Miss Kate graciously.\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t time.\"\\n\\n\"Your mamma prefers other accomplishments, I fancy.  So did mine, but I\\nproved to her that I had talent by taking a few lessons privately, and\\nthen she was quite willing I should go on.  Can\\'t you do the same with\\nyour governess?\"\\n\\n\"I have none.\"\\n\\n\"I forgot young ladies in America go to school more than with us.  Very\\nfine schools they are, too, Papa says.  You go to a private one, I\\nsuppose?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t go at all.  I am a governess myself.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said Miss Kate, but she might as well have said, \"Dear\\nme, how dreadful!\" for her tone implied it, and something in her face\\nmade Meg color, and wish she had not been so frank.\\n\\nMr. Brooke looked up and said quickly, \"Young ladies in America love\\nindependence as much as their ancestors did, and are admired and\\nrespected for supporting themselves.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, of course it\\'s very nice and proper in them to do so.  We\\nhave many most respectable and worthy young women who do the same and\\nare employed by the nobility, because, being the daughters of\\ngentlemen, they are both well bred and accomplished, you know,\" said\\nMiss Kate in a patronizing tone that hurt Meg\\'s pride, and made her\\nwork seem not only more distasteful, but degrading.\\n\\n\"Did the German song suit, Miss March?\" inquired Mr. Brooke, breaking\\nan awkward pause.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!  It was very sweet, and I\\'m much obliged to whoever\\ntranslated it for me.\" And Meg\\'s downcast face brightened as she spoke.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you read German?\" asked Miss Kate with a look of surprise.\\n\\n\"Not very well.  My father, who taught me, is away, and I don\\'t get on\\nvery fast alone, for I\\'ve no one to correct my pronunciation.\"\\n\\n\"Try a little now.  Here is Schiller\\'s Mary Stuart and a tutor who\\nloves to teach.\"  And Mr. Brooke laid his book on her lap with an\\ninviting smile.\\n\\n\"It\\'s so hard I\\'m afraid to try,\" said Meg, grateful, but bashful in\\nthe presence of the accomplished young lady beside her.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll read a bit to encourage you.\" And Miss Kate read one of the most\\nbeautiful passages in a perfectly correct but perfectly expressionless\\nmanner.\\n\\nMr. Brooke made no comment as she returned the book to Meg, who said\\ninnocently, \"I thought it was poetry.\"\\n\\n\"Some of it is.  Try this passage.\"\\n\\nThere was a queer smile about Mr. Brooke\\'s mouth as he opened at poor\\nMary\\'s lament.\\n\\nMeg obediently following the long grass-blade which her new tutor used\\nto point with, read slowly and timidly, unconsciously making poetry of\\nthe hard words by the soft intonation of her musical voice.  Down the\\npage went the green guide, and presently, forgetting her listener in\\nthe beauty of the sad scene, Meg read as if alone, giving a little\\ntouch of tragedy to the words of the unhappy queen.  If she had seen\\nthe brown eyes then, she would have stopped short, but she never looked\\nup, and the lesson was not spoiled for her.\\n\\n\"Very well indeed!\" said Mr. Brooke, as she paused, quite ignoring her\\nmany mistakes, and looking as if he did indeed love to teach.\\n\\nMiss Kate put up her glass, and, having taken a survey of the little\\ntableau before her, shut her sketch book, saying with condescension,\\n\"You\\'ve a nice accent and in time will be a clever reader.  I advise\\nyou to learn, for German is a valuable accomplishment to teachers.  I\\nmust look after Grace, she is romping.\" And Miss Kate strolled away,\\nadding to herself with a shrug, \"I didn\\'t come to chaperone a\\ngoverness, though she is young and pretty.  What odd people these\\nYankees are.  I\\'m afraid Laurie will be quite spoiled among them.\"\\n\\n\"I forgot that English people rather turn up their noses at governesses\\nand don\\'t treat them as we do,\" said Meg, looking after the retreating\\nfigure with an annoyed expression.\\n\\n\"Tutors also have rather a hard time of it there, as I know to my\\nsorrow.  There\\'s no place like America for us workers, Miss Margaret.\"\\nAnd Mr. Brooke looked so contented and cheerful that Meg was ashamed to\\nlament her hard lot.\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad I live in it then.  I don\\'t like my work, but I get a good\\ndeal of satisfaction out of it after all, so I won\\'t complain. I only\\nwished I liked teaching as you do.\"\\n\\n\"I think you would if you had Laurie for a pupil.  I shall be very\\nsorry to lose him next year,\" said Mr. Brooke, busily punching holes in\\nthe turf.\\n\\n\"Going to college, I suppose?\" Meg\\'s lips asked the question, but her\\neyes added, \"And what becomes of you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, it\\'s high time he went, for he is ready, and as soon as he is\\noff, I shall turn soldier.  I am needed.\"\\n\\n\"I am glad of that!\" exclaimed Meg.  \"I should think every young man\\nwould want to go, though it is hard for the mothers and sisters who\\nstay at home,\" she added sorrowfully.\\n\\n\"I have neither, and very few friends to care whether I live or die,\"\\nsaid Mr. Brooke rather bitterly as he absently put the dead rose in the\\nhole he had made and covered it up, like a little grave.\\n\\n\"Laurie and his grandfather would care a great deal, and we should all\\nbe very sorry to have any harm happen to you,\" said Meg heartily.\\n\\n\"Thank you, that sounds pleasant,\" began Mr. Brooke, looking cheerful\\nagain, but before he could finish his speech, Ned, mounted on the old\\nhorse, came lumbering up to display his equestrian skill before the\\nyoung ladies, and there was no more quiet that day.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you love to ride?\" asked Grace of Amy, as they stood resting\\nafter a race round the field with the others, led by Ned.\\n\\n\"I dote upon it.  My sister, Meg, used to ride when Papa was rich, but\\nwe don\\'t keep any horses now, except Ellen Tree,\" added Amy, laughing.\\n\\n\"Tell me about Ellen Tree.  Is it a donkey?\" asked Grace curiously.\\n\\n\"Why, you see, Jo is crazy about horses and so am I, but we\\'ve only got\\nan old sidesaddle and no horse.  Out in our garden is an apple tree\\nthat has a nice low branch, so Jo put the saddle on it, fixed some\\nreins on the part that turns up, and we bounce away on Ellen Tree\\nwhenever we like.\"\\n\\n\"How funny!\" laughed Grace.  \"I have a pony at home, and ride nearly\\nevery day in the park with Fred and Kate.  It\\'s very nice, for my\\nfriends go too, and the Row is full of ladies and gentlemen.\"\\n\\n\"Dear, how charming!  I hope I shall go abroad some day, but I\\'d rather\\ngo to Rome than the Row,\" said Amy, who had not the remotest idea what\\nthe Row was and wouldn\\'t have asked for the world.\\n\\nFrank, sitting just behind the little girls, heard what they were\\nsaying, and pushed his crutch away from him with an impatient gesture\\nas he watched the active lads going through all sorts of comical\\ngymnastics.  Beth, who was collecting the scattered Author cards,\\nlooked up and said, in her shy yet friendly way, \"I\\'m afraid you are\\ntired.  Can I do anything for you?\"\\n\\n\"Talk to me, please.  It\\'s dull, sitting by myself,\" answered Frank,\\nwho had evidently been used to being made much of at home.\\n\\nIf he asked her to deliver a Latin oration, it would not have seemed a\\nmore impossible task to bashful Beth, but there was no place to run to,\\nno Jo to hide behind now, and the poor boy looked so wistfully at her\\nthat she bravely resolved to try.\\n\\n\"What do you like to talk about?\" she asked, fumbling over the cards\\nand dropping half as she tried to tie them up.\\n\\n\"Well, I like to hear about cricket and boating and hunting,\" said\\nFrank, who had not yet learned to suit his amusements to his strength.\\n\\nMy heart!  What shall I do?  I don\\'t know anything about them, thought\\nBeth, and forgetting the boy\\'s misfortune in her flurry, she said,\\nhoping to make him talk, \"I never saw any hunting, but I suppose you\\nknow all about it.\"\\n\\n\"I did once, but I can never hunt again, for I got hurt leaping a\\nconfounded five-barred gate, so there are no more horses and hounds for\\nme,\" said Frank with a sigh that made Beth hate herself for her\\ninnocent blunder.\\n\\n\"Your deer are much prettier than our ugly buffaloes,\" she said,\\nturning to the prairies for help and feeling glad that she had read one\\nof the boys\\' books in which Jo delighted.\\n\\nBuffaloes proved soothing and satisfactory, and in her eagerness to\\namuse another, Beth forgot herself, and was quite unconscious of her\\nsisters\\' surprise and delight at the unusual spectacle of Beth talking\\naway to one of the dreadful boys, against whom she had begged\\nprotection.\\n\\n\"Bless her heart!  She pities him, so she is good to him,\" said Jo,\\nbeaming at her from the croquet ground.\\n\\n\"I always said she was a little saint,\" added Meg, as if there could be\\nno further doubt of it.\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t heard Frank laugh so much for ever so long,\" said Grace to\\nAmy, as they sat discussing dolls and making tea sets out of the acorn\\ncups.\\n\\n\"My sister Beth is a very fastidious girl, when she likes to be,\" said\\nAmy, well pleased at Beth\\'s success.  She meant \\'facinating\\', but as\\nGrace didn\\'t know the exact meaning of either word, fastidious sounded\\nwell and made a good impression.\\n\\nAn impromptu circus, fox and geese, and an amicable game of croquet\\nfinished the afternoon.  At sunset the tent was struck, hampers packed,\\nwickets pulled up, boats loaded, and the whole party floated down the\\nriver, singing at the tops of their voices. Ned, getting sentimental,\\nwarbled a serenade with the pensive refrain...\\n\\n    Alone, alone, ah! Woe, alone,\\n\\nand at the lines...\\n\\n    We each are young, we each have a heart,\\n    Oh, why should we stand thus coldly apart?\\n\\nhe looked at Meg with such a lackadiasical expression that she laughed\\noutright and spoiled his song.\\n\\n\"How can you be so cruel to me?\" he whispered, under cover of a lively\\nchorus.  \"You\\'ve kept close to that starched-up Englishwoman all day,\\nand now you snub me.\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t mean to, but you looked so funny I really couldn\\'t help it,\"\\nreplied Meg, passing over the first part of his reproach, for it was\\nquite true that she had shunned him, remembering the Moffat party and\\nthe talk after it.\\n\\nNed was offended and turned to Sallie for consolation, saying to her\\nrather pettishly, \"There isn\\'t a bit of flirt in that girl, is there?\"\\n\\n\"Not a particle, but she\\'s a dear,\" returned Sallie, defending her\\nfriend even while confessing her shortcomings.\\n\\n\"She\\'s not a stricken deer anyway,\" said Ned, trying to be witty, and\\nsucceeding as well as very young gentlemen usually do.\\n\\nOn the lawn where it had gathered, the little party separated with\\ncordial good nights and good-byes, for the Vaughns were going to Canada.\\nAs the four sisters went home through the garden, Miss Kate looked\\nafter them, saying, without the patronizing tone in her voice, \"In\\nspite of their demonstrative manners, American girls are very nice when\\none knows them.\"\\n\\n\"I quite agree with you,\" said Mr. Brooke.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'THIRTEEN\\n\\nCASTLES IN THE AIR\\n\\nLaurie lay luxuriously swinging to and fro in his hammock one warm\\nSeptember afternoon, wondering what his neighbors were about, but too\\nlazy to go and find out.  He was in one of his moods, for the day had\\nbeen both unprofitable and unsatisfactory, and he was wishing he could\\nlive it over again.  The hot weather made him indolent, and he had\\nshirked his studies, tried Mr. Brooke\\'s patience to the utmost,\\ndispleased his grandfather by practicing half the afternoon, frightened\\nthe maidservants half out of their wits by mischievously hinting that\\none of his dogs was going mad, and, after high words with the stableman\\nabout some fancied neglect of his horse, he had flung himself into his\\nhammock to fume over the stupidity of the world in general, till the\\npeace of the lovely day quieted him in spite of himself. Staring up\\ninto the green gloom of the horse-chestnut trees above him, he dreamed\\ndreams of all sorts, and was just imagining himself tossing on the\\nocean in a voyage round the world, when the sound of voices brought him\\nashore in a flash. Peeping through the meshes of the hammock, he saw\\nthe Marches coming out, as if bound on some expedition.\\n\\n\"What in the world are those girls about now?\" thought Laurie, opening\\nhis sleepy eyes to take a good look, for there was something rather\\npeculiar in the appearance of his neighbors.  Each wore a large,\\nflapping hat, a brown linen pouch slung over one shoulder, and carried\\na long staff.  Meg had a cushion, Jo a book, Beth a basket, and Amy a\\nportfolio.  All walked quietly through the garden, out at the little\\nback gate, and began to climb the hill that lay between the house and\\nriver.\\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s cool,\" said Laurie to himself, \"to have a picnic and\\nnever ask me!  They can\\'t be going in the boat, for they haven\\'t got\\nthe key.  Perhaps they forgot it.  I\\'ll take it to them, and see what\\'s\\ngoing on.\"\\n\\nThough possessed of half a dozen hats, it took him some time to find\\none, then there was a hunt for the key, which was at last discovered in\\nhis pocket, so that the girls were quite out of sight when he leaped\\nthe fence and ran after them.  Taking the shortest way to the\\nboathouse, he waited for them to appear, but no one came, and he went\\nup the hill to take an observation.  A grove of pines covered one part\\nof it, and from the heart of this green spot came a clearer sound than\\nthe soft sigh of the pines or the drowsy chirp of the crickets.\\n\\n\"Here\\'s a landscape!\" thought Laurie, peeping through the bushes, and\\nlooking wide-awake and good-natured already.\\n\\nIt was a rather pretty little picture, for the sisters sat together in\\nthe shady nook, with sun and shadow flickering over them, the aromatic\\nwind lifting their hair and cooling their hot cheeks, and all the\\nlittle wood people going on with their affairs as if these were no\\nstrangers but old friends.  Meg sat upon her cushion, sewing daintily\\nwith her white hands, and looking as fresh and sweet as a rose in her\\npink dress among the green.  Beth was sorting the cones that lay thick\\nunder the hemlock near by, for she made pretty things with them.  Amy\\nwas sketching a group of ferns, and Jo was knitting as she read aloud.\\nA shadow passed over the boy\\'s face as he watched them, feeling that he\\nought to go away because uninvited; yet lingering because home seemed\\nvery lonely and this quiet party in the woods most attractive to his\\nrestless spirit.  He stood so still that a squirrel, busy with its\\nharvesting, ran down a pine close beside him, saw him suddenly and\\nskipped back, scolding so shrilly that Beth looked up, espied the\\nwistful face behind the birches, and beckoned with a reassuring smile.\\n\\n\"May I come in, please?  Or shall I be a bother?\" he asked, advancing\\nslowly.\\n\\nMeg lifted her eyebrows, but Jo scowled at her defiantly and said at\\nonce, \"Of course you may.  We should have asked you before, only we\\nthought you wouldn\\'t care for such a girl\\'s game as this.\"\\n\\n\"I always like your games, but if Meg doesn\\'t want me, I\\'ll go away.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve no objection, if you do something.  It\\'s against the rules to be\\nidle here,\" replied Meg gravely but graciously.\\n\\n\"Much obliged.  I\\'ll do anything if you\\'ll let me stop a bit, for it\\'s\\nas dull as the Desert of Sahara down there.  Shall I sew, read, cone,\\ndraw, or do all at once? Bring on your bears. I\\'m ready.\"  And Laurie\\nsat down with a submissive expression delightful to behold.\\n\\n\"Finish this story while I set my heel,\" said Jo, handing him the book.\\n\\n\"Yes\\'m.\" was the meek answer, as he began, doing his best to prove his\\ngratitude for the favor of admission into the \\'Busy Bee Society\\'.\\n\\nThe story was not a long one, and when it was finished, he ventured to\\nask a few questions as a reward of merit.\\n\\n\"Please, ma\\'am, could I inquire if this highly instructive and charming\\ninstitution is a new one?\"\\n\\n\"Would you tell him?\" asked Meg of her sisters.\\n\\n\"He\\'ll laugh,\" said Amy warningly.\\n\\n\"Who cares?\" said Jo.\\n\\n\"I guess he\\'ll like it,\" added Beth.\\n\\n\"Of course I shall!  I give you my word I won\\'t laugh.  Tell away, Jo,\\nand don\\'t be afraid.\"\\n\\n\"The idea of being afraid of you!  Well, you see we used to play\\nPilgrim\\'s Progress, and we have been going on with it in earnest, all\\nwinter and summer.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Laurie, nodding wisely.\\n\\n\"Who told you?\" demanded Jo.\\n\\n\"Spirits.\"\\n\\n\"No, I did.  I wanted to amuse him one night when you were all away,\\nand he was rather dismal.  He did like it, so don\\'t scold, Jo,\" said\\nBeth meekly.\\n\\n\"You can\\'t keep a secret.  Never mind, it saves trouble now.\"\\n\\n\"Go on, please,\" said Laurie, as Jo became absorbed in her work,\\nlooking a trifle displeased.\\n\\n\"Oh, didn\\'t she tell you about this new plan of ours?  Well, we have\\ntried not to waste our holiday, but each has had a task and worked at\\nit with a will.  The vacation is nearly over, the stints are all done,\\nand we are ever so glad that we didn\\'t dawdle.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I should think so,\" and Laurie thought regretfully of his own\\nidle days.\\n\\n\"Mother likes to have us out-of-doors as much as possible, so we bring\\nour work here and have nice times.  For the fun of it we bring our\\nthings in these bags, wear the old hats, use poles to climb the hill,\\nand play pilgrims, as we used to do years ago.  We call this hill the\\nDelectable Mountain, for we can look far away and see the country where\\nwe hope to live some time.\"\\n\\nJo pointed, and Laurie sat up to examine, for through an opening in the\\nwood one could look cross the wide, blue river, the meadows on the\\nother side, far over the outskirts of the great city, to the green\\nhills that rose to meet the sky.  The sun was low, and the heavens\\nglowed with the splendor of an autumn sunset.  Gold and purple clouds\\nlay on the hilltops, and rising high into the ruddy light were silvery\\nwhite peaks that shone like the airy spires of some Celestial City.\\n\\n\"How beautiful that is!\" said Laurie softly, for he was quick to see\\nand feel beauty of any kind.\\n\\n\"It\\'s often so, and we like to watch it, for it is never the same, but\\nalways splendid,\" replied Amy, wishing she could paint it.\\n\\n\"Jo talks about the country where we hope to live sometime--the real\\ncountry, she means, with pigs and chickens and haymaking. It would be\\nnice, but I wish the beautiful country up there was real, and we could\\never go to it,\" said Beth musingly.\\n\\n\"There is a lovelier country even than that, where we shall go,\\nby-and-by, when we are good enough,\" answered Meg with her sweetest\\nvoice.\\n\\n\"It seems so long to wait, so hard to do.  I want to fly away at once,\\nas those swallows fly, and go in at that splendid gate.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll get there, Beth, sooner or later, no fear of that,\" said Jo.\\n\"I\\'m the one that will have to fight and work, and climb and wait, and\\nmaybe never get in after all.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll have me for company, if that\\'s any comfort.  I shall have to do\\na deal of traveling before I come in sight of your Celestial City.  If\\nI arrive late, you\\'ll say a good word for me, won\\'t you, Beth?\"\\n\\nSomething in the boy\\'s face troubled his little friend, but she said\\ncheerfully, with her quiet eyes on the changing clouds, \"If people\\nreally want to go, and really try all their lives, I think they will\\nget in, for I don\\'t believe there are any locks on that door or any\\nguards at the gate.  I always imagine it is as it is in the picture,\\nwhere the shining ones stretch out their hands to welcome poor\\nChristian as he comes up from the river.\"\\n\\n\"Wouldn\\'t it be fun if all the castles in the air which we make could\\ncome true, and we could live in them?\" said Jo, after a little pause.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve made such quantities it would be hard to choose which I\\'d have,\"\\nsaid Laurie, lying flat and throwing cones at the squirrel who had\\nbetrayed him.\\n\\n\"You\\'d have to take your favorite one.  What is it?\" asked Meg.\\n\\n\"If I tell mine, will you tell yours?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, if the girls will too.\"\\n\\n\"We will.  Now, Laurie.\"\\n\\n\"After I\\'d seen as much of the world as I want to, I\\'d like to settle\\nin Germany and have just as much music as I choose.  I\\'m to be a famous\\nmusician myself, and all creation is to rush to hear me.  And I\\'m never\\nto be bothered about money or business, but just enjoy myself and live\\nfor what I like.  That\\'s my favorite castle. What\\'s yours, Meg?\"\\n\\nMargaret seemed to find it a little hard to tell hers, and waved a\\nbrake before her face, as if to disperse imaginary gnats, while she\\nsaid slowly, \"I should like a lovely house, full of all sorts of\\nluxurious things--nice food, pretty clothes, handsome furniture,\\npleasant people, and heaps of money.  I am to be mistress of it, and\\nmanage it as I like, with plenty of servants, so I never need work a\\nbit.  How I should enjoy it!  For I wouldn\\'t be idle, but do good, and\\nmake everyone love me dearly.\"\\n\\n\"Wouldn\\'t you have a master for your castle in the air?\" asked Laurie\\nslyly.\\n\\n\"I said \\'pleasant people\\', you know,\" and Meg carefully tied up her\\nshoe as she spoke, so that no one saw her face.\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you say you\\'d have a splendid, wise, good husband and some\\nangelic little children?  You know your castle wouldn\\'t be perfect\\nwithout,\" said blunt Jo, who had no tender fancies yet, and rather\\nscorned romance, except in books.\\n\\n\"You\\'d have nothing but horses, inkstands, and novels in yours,\"\\nanswered Meg petulantly.\\n\\n\"Wouldn\\'t I though?  I\\'d have a stable full of Arabian steeds, rooms\\npiled high with books, and I\\'d write out of a magic inkstand, so that\\nmy works should be as famous as Laurie\\'s music.  I want to do something\\nsplendid before I go into my castle, something heroic or wonderful that\\nwon\\'t be forgotten after I\\'m dead.  I don\\'t know what, but I\\'m on the\\nwatch for it, and mean to astonish you all some day.  I think I shall\\nwrite books, and get rich and famous, that would suit me, so that is my\\nfavorite dream.\"\\n\\n\"Mine is to stay at home safe with Father and Mother, and help take\\ncare of the family,\" said Beth contentedly.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you wish for anything else?\" asked Laurie.\\n\\n\"Since I had my little piano, I am perfectly satisfied.  I only wish we\\nmay all keep well and be together, nothing else.\"\\n\\n\"I have ever so many wishes, but the pet one is to be an artist, and go\\nto Rome, and do fine pictures, and be the best artist in the whole\\nworld,\" was Amy\\'s modest desire.\\n\\n\"We\\'re an ambitious set, aren\\'t we?  Every one of us, but Beth, wants\\nto be rich and famous, and gorgeous in every respect. I do wonder if\\nany of us will ever get our wishes,\" said Laurie, chewing grass like a\\nmeditative calf.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got the key to my castle in the air, but whether I can unlock the\\ndoor remains to be seen,\" observed Jo mysteriously.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got the key to mine, but I\\'m not allowed to try it. Hang\\ncollege!\" muttered Laurie with an impatient sigh.\\n\\n\"Here\\'s mine!\" and Amy waved her pencil.\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t got any,\" said Meg forlornly.\\n\\n\"Yes, you have,\" said Laurie at once.\\n\\n\"Where?\"\\n\\n\"In your face.\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense, that\\'s of no use.\"\\n\\n\"Wait and see if it doesn\\'t bring you something worth having,\" replied\\nthe boy, laughing at the thought of a charming little secret which he\\nfancied he knew.\\n\\nMeg colored behind the brake, but asked no questions and looked across\\nthe river with the same expectant expression which Mr. Brooke had worn\\nwhen he told the story of the knight.\\n\\n\"If we are all alive ten years hence, let\\'s meet, and see how many of\\nus have got our wishes, or how much nearer we are then than now,\" said\\nJo, always ready with a plan.\\n\\n\"Bless me!  How old I shall be, twenty-seven!\" exclaimed Meg, who felt\\ngrown up already, having just reached seventeen.\\n\\n\"You and I will be twenty-six, Teddy, Beth twenty-four, and Amy\\ntwenty-two.  What a venerable party!\" said Jo.\\n\\n\"I hope I shall have done something to be proud of by that time, but\\nI\\'m such a lazy dog, I\\'m afraid I shall dawdle, Jo.\"\\n\\n\"You need a motive, Mother says, and when you get it, she is sure\\nyou\\'ll work splendidly.\"\\n\\n\"Is she?  By Jupiter, I will, if I only get the chance!\" cried Laurie,\\nsitting up with sudden energy.  \"I ought to be satisfied to please\\nGrandfather, and I do try, but it\\'s working against the grain, you see,\\nand comes hard.  He wants me to be an India merchant, as he was, and\\nI\\'d rather be shot.  I hate tea and silk and spices, and every sort of\\nrubbish his old ships bring, and I don\\'t care how soon they go to the\\nbottom when I own them.  Going to college ought to satisfy him, for if\\nI give him four years he ought to let me off from the business.  But\\nhe\\'s set, and I\\'ve got to do just as he did, unless I break away and\\nplease myself, as my father did.  If there was anyone left to stay with\\nthe old gentleman, I\\'d do it tomorrow.\"\\n\\nLaurie spoke excitedly, and looked ready to carry his threat into\\nexecution on the slightest provocation, for he was growing up very fast\\nand, in spite of his indolent ways, had a young man\\'s hatred of\\nsubjection, a young man\\'s restless longing to try the world for himself.\\n\\n\"I advise you to sail away in one of your ships, and never come home\\nagain till you have tried your own way,\" said Jo, whose imagination was\\nfired by the thought of such a daring exploit, and whose sympathy was\\nexcited by what she called \\'Teddy\\'s Wrongs\\'.\\n\\n\"That\\'s not right, Jo.  You mustn\\'t talk in that way, and Laurie\\nmustn\\'t take your bad advice.  You should do just what your grandfather\\nwishes, my dear boy,\" said Meg in her most maternal tone. \"Do your best\\nat college, and when he sees that you try to please him, I\\'m sure he\\nwon\\'t be hard on you or unjust to you.  As you say, there is no one\\nelse to stay with and love him, and you\\'d never forgive yourself if you\\nleft him without his permission.  Don\\'t be dismal or fret, but do your\\nduty and you\\'ll get your reward, as good Mr. Brooke has, by being\\nrespected and loved.\"\\n\\n\"What do you know about him?\" asked Laurie, grateful for the good\\nadvice, but objecting to the lecture, and glad to turn the conversation\\nfrom himself after his unusual outbreak.\\n\\n\"Only what your grandpa told us about him, how he took good care of his\\nown mother till she died, and wouldn\\'t go abroad as tutor to some nice\\nperson because he wouldn\\'t leave her.  And how he provides now for an\\nold woman who nursed his mother, and never tells anyone, but is just as\\ngenerous and patient and good as he can be.\"\\n\\n\"So he is, dear old fellow!\" said Laurie heartily, as Meg paused,\\nlooking flushed and earnest with her story.  \"It\\'s like Grandpa to find\\nout all about him without letting him know, and to tell all his\\ngoodness to others, so that they might like him. Brooke couldn\\'t\\nunderstand why your mother was so kind to him, asking him over with me\\nand treating him in her beautiful friendly way.  He thought she was\\njust perfect, and talked about it for days and days, and went on about\\nyou all in flaming style.  If ever I do get my wish, you see what I\\'ll\\ndo for Brooke.\"\\n\\n\"Begin to do something now by not plaguing his life out,\" said Meg\\nsharply.\\n\\n\"How do you know I do, Miss?\"\\n\\n\"I can always tell by his face when he goes away.  If you have been\\ngood, he looks satisfied and walks briskly.  If you have plagued him,\\nhe\\'s sober and walks slowly, as if he wanted to go back and do his work\\nbetter.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I like that?  So you keep an account of my good and bad marks in\\nBrooke\\'s face, do you?  I see him bow and smile as he passes your\\nwindow, but I didn\\'t know you\\'d got up a telegraph.\"\\n\\n\"We haven\\'t.  Don\\'t be angry, and oh, don\\'t tell him I said anything!\\nIt was only to show that I cared how you get on, and what is said here\\nis said in confidence, you know,\" cried Meg, much alarmed at the\\nthought of what might follow from her careless speech.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t tell tales,\" replied Laurie, with his \\'high and mighty\\' air,\\nas Jo called a certain expression which he occasionally wore. \"Only if\\nBrooke is going to be a thermometer, I must mind and have fair weather\\nfor him to report.\"\\n\\n\"Please don\\'t be offended.  I didn\\'t mean to preach or tell tales or be\\nsilly.  I only thought Jo was encouraging you in a feeling which you\\'d\\nbe sorry for by-and-by.  You are so kind to us, we feel as if you were\\nour brother and say just what we think. Forgive me, I meant it kindly.\"\\nAnd Meg offered her hand with a gesture both affectionate and timid.\\n\\nAshamed of his momentary pique, Laurie squeezed the kind little hand,\\nand said frankly, \"I\\'m the one to be forgiven.  I\\'m cross and have been\\nout of sorts all day.  I like to have you tell me my faults and be\\nsisterly, so don\\'t mind if I am grumpy sometimes.  I thank you all the\\nsame.\"\\n\\nBent on showing that he was not offended, he made himself as agreeable\\nas possible, wound cotton for Meg, recited poetry to please Jo, shook\\ndown cones for Beth, and helped Amy with her ferns, proving himself a\\nfit person to belong to the \\'Busy Bee Society\\'.  In the midst of an\\nanimated discussion on the domestic habits of turtles (one of those\\namiable creatures having strolled up from the river), the faint sound\\nof a bell warned them that Hannah had put the tea \\'to draw\\', and they\\nwould just have time to get home to supper.\\n\\n\"May I come again?\" asked Laurie.\\n\\n\"Yes, if you are good, and love your book, as the boys in the primer\\nare told to do,\" said Meg, smiling.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll try.\"\\n\\n\"Then you may come, and I\\'ll teach you to knit as the Scotchmen do.\\nThere\\'s a demand for socks just now,\" added Jo, waving hers like a big\\nblue worsted banner as they parted at the gate.\\n\\nThat night, when Beth played to Mr. Laurence in the twilight, Laurie,\\nstanding in the shadow of the curtain, listened to the little David,\\nwhose simple music always quieted his moody spirit, and watched the old\\nman, who sat with his gray head on his hand, thinking tender thoughts\\nof the dead child he had loved so much. Remembering the conversation of\\nthe afternoon, the boy said to himself, with the resolve to make the\\nsacrifice cheerfully, \"I\\'ll let my castle go, and stay with the dear\\nold gentleman while he needs me, for I am all he has.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'FOURTEEN\\n\\nSECRETS\\n\\nJo was very busy in the garret, for the October days began to grow\\nchilly, and the afternoons were short.  For two or three hours the sun\\nlay warmly in the high window, showing Jo seated on the old sofa,\\nwriting busily, with her papers spread out upon a trunk before her,\\nwhile Scrabble, the pet rat, promenaded the beams overhead, accompanied\\nby his oldest son, a fine young fellow, who was evidently very proud of\\nhis whiskers. Quite absorbed in her work, Jo scribbled away till the\\nlast page was filled, when she signed her name with a flourish and\\nthrew down her pen, exclaiming...\\n\\n\"There, I\\'ve done my best!  If this won\\'t suit I shall have to wait\\ntill I can do better.\"\\n\\nLying back on the sofa, she read the manuscript carefully through,\\nmaking dashes here and there, and putting in many exclamation points,\\nwhich looked like little balloons.  Then she tied it up with a smart\\nred ribbon, and sat a minute looking at it with a sober, wistful\\nexpression, which plainly showed how earnest her work had been.  Jo\\'s\\ndesk up here was an old tin kitchen which hung against the wall.  In it\\nshe kept her papers, and a few books, safely shut away from Scrabble,\\nwho, being likewise of a literary turn, was fond of making a\\ncirculating library of such books as were left in his way by eating the\\nleaves.  From this tin receptacle Jo produced another manuscript, and\\nputting both in her pocket, crept quietly downstairs, leaving her\\nfriends to nibble on her pens and taste her ink.\\n\\nShe put on her hat and jacket as noiselessly as possible, and going to\\nthe back entry window, got out upon the roof of a low porch, swung\\nherself down to the grassy bank, and took a roundabout way to the road.\\nOnce there, she composed herself, hailed a passing omnibus, and rolled\\naway to town, looking very merry and mysterious.\\n\\nIf anyone had been watching her, he would have thought her movements\\ndecidedly peculiar, for on alighting, she went off at a great pace till\\nshe reached a certain number in a certain busy street.  Having found\\nthe place with some difficulty, she went into the doorway, looked up\\nthe dirty stairs, and after standing stock still a minute, suddenly\\ndived into the street and walked away as rapidly as she came.  This\\nmaneuver she repeated several times, to the great amusement of a\\nblack-eyed young gentleman lounging in the window of a building\\nopposite.  On returning for the third time, Jo gave herself a shake,\\npulled her hat over her eyes, and walked up the stairs, looking as if\\nshe were going to have all her teeth out.\\n\\nThere was a dentist\\'s sign, among others, which adorned the entrance,\\nand after staring a moment at the pair of artificial jaws which slowly\\nopened and shut to draw attention to a fine set of teeth, the young\\ngentleman put on his coat, took his hat, and went down to post himself\\nin the opposite doorway, saying with a smile and a shiver, \"It\\'s like\\nher to come alone, but if she has a bad time she\\'ll need someone to\\nhelp her home.\"\\n\\nIn ten minutes Jo came running downstairs with a very red face and the\\ngeneral appearance of a person who had just passed through a trying\\nordeal of some sort.  When she saw the young gentleman she looked\\nanything but pleased, and passed him with a nod.  But he followed,\\nasking with an air of sympathy, \"Did you have a bad time?\"\\n\\n\"Not very.\"\\n\\n\"You got through quickly.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, thank goodness!\"\\n\\n\"Why did you go alone?\"\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t want anyone to know.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re the oddest fellow I ever saw.  How many did you have out?\"\\n\\nJo looked at her friend as if she did not understand him, then began to\\nlaugh as if mightily amused at something.\\n\\n\"There are two which I want to have come out, but I must wait a week.\"\\n\\n\"What are you laughing at?  You are up to some mischief, Jo,\" said\\nLaurie, looking mystified.\\n\\n\"So are you.  What were you doing, sir, up in that billiard saloon?\"\\n\\n\"Begging your pardon, ma\\'am, it wasn\\'t a billiard saloon, but a\\ngymnasium, and I was taking a lesson in fencing.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad of that.\"\\n\\n\"Why?\"\\n\\n\"You can teach me, and then when we play _Hamlet_, you can be Laertes,\\nand we\\'ll make a fine thing of the fencing scene.\"\\n\\nLaurie burst out with a hearty boy\\'s laugh, which made several\\npassers-by smile in spite of themselves.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll teach you whether we play _Hamlet_ or not.  It\\'s grand fun and\\nwill straighten you up capitally.  But I don\\'t believe that was your\\nonly reason for saying \\'I\\'m glad\\' in that decided way, was it now?\"\\n\\n\"No, I was glad that you were not in the saloon, because I hope you\\nnever go to such places.  Do you?\"\\n\\n\"Not often.\"\\n\\n\"I wish you wouldn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s no harm, Jo.  I have billiards at home, but it\\'s no fun unless\\nyou have good players, so, as I\\'m fond of it, I come sometimes and have\\na game with Ned Moffat or some of the other fellows.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, dear, I\\'m so sorry, for you\\'ll get to liking it better and better,\\nand will waste time and money, and grow like those dreadful boys.  I\\ndid hope you\\'d stay respectable and be a satisfaction to your friends,\"\\nsaid Jo, shaking her head.\\n\\n\"Can\\'t a fellow take a little innocent amusement now and then without\\nlosing his respectability?\" asked Laurie, looking nettled.\\n\\n\"That depends upon how and where he takes it.  I don\\'t like Ned and his\\nset, and wish you\\'d keep out of it.  Mother won\\'t let us have him at\\nour house, though he wants to come.  And if you grow like him she won\\'t\\nbe willing to have us frolic together as we do now.\"\\n\\n\"Won\\'t she?\" asked Laurie anxiously.\\n\\n\"No, she can\\'t bear fashionable young men, and she\\'d shut us all up in\\nbandboxes rather than have us associate with them.\"\\n\\n\"Well, she needn\\'t get out her bandboxes yet.  I\\'m not a fashionable\\nparty and don\\'t mean to be, but I do like harmless larks now and then,\\ndon\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, nobody minds them, so lark away, but don\\'t get wild, will you?\\nOr there will be an end of all our good times.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll be a double distilled saint.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t bear saints.  Just be a simple, honest, respectable boy, and\\nwe\\'ll never desert you.  I don\\'t know what I should do if you acted\\nlike Mr. King\\'s son.  He had plenty of money, but didn\\'t know how to\\nspend it, and got tipsy and gambled, and ran away, and forged his\\nfather\\'s name, I believe, and was altogether horrid.\"\\n\\n\"You think I\\'m likely to do the same?  Much obliged.\"\\n\\n\"No, I don\\'t--oh, dear, no!--but I hear people talking about money\\nbeing such a temptation, and I sometimes wish you were poor. I\\nshouldn\\'t worry then.\"\\n\\n\"Do you worry about me, Jo?\"\\n\\n\"A little, when you look moody and discontented, as you sometimes do,\\nfor you\\'ve got such a strong will, if you once get started wrong, I\\'m\\nafraid it would be hard to stop you.\"\\n\\nLaurie walked in silence a few minutes, and Jo watched him, wishing she\\nhad held her tongue, for his eyes looked angry, though his lips smiled\\nas if at her warnings.\\n\\n\"Are you going to deliver lectures all the way home?\" he asked\\npresently.\\n\\n\"Of course not.  Why?\"\\n\\n\"Because if you are, I\\'ll take a bus.  If you\\'re not, I\\'d like to walk\\nwith you and tell you something very interesting.\"\\n\\n\"I won\\'t preach any more, and I\\'d like to hear the news immensely.\"\\n\\n\"Very well, then, come on.  It\\'s a secret, and if I tell you, you must\\ntell me yours.\"\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t got any,\" began Jo, but stopped suddenly, remembering that\\nshe had.\\n\\n\"You know you have--you can\\'t hide anything, so up and \\'fess, or I\\nwon\\'t tell,\" cried Laurie.\\n\\n\"Is your secret a nice one?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, isn\\'t it!  All about people you know, and such fun!  You ought to\\nhear it, and I\\'ve been aching to tell it this long time. Come, you\\nbegin.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll not say anything about it at home, will you?\"\\n\\n\"Not a word.\"\\n\\n\"And you won\\'t tease me in private?\"\\n\\n\"I never tease.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, you do.  You get everything you want out of people.  I don\\'t know\\nhow you do it, but you are a born wheedler.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you.  Fire away.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ve left two stories with a newspaperman, and he\\'s to give his\\nanswer next week,\" whispered Jo, in her confidant\\'s ear.\\n\\n\"Hurrah for Miss March, the celebrated American authoress!\" cried\\nLaurie, throwing up his hat and catching it again, to the great delight\\nof two ducks, four cats, five hens, and half a dozen Irish children,\\nfor they were out of the city now.\\n\\n\"Hush!  It won\\'t come to anything, I dare say, but I couldn\\'t rest till\\nI had tried, and I said nothing about it because I didn\\'t want anyone\\nelse to be disappointed.\"\\n\\n\"It won\\'t fail.  Why, Jo, your stories are works of Shakespeare\\ncompared to half the rubbish that is published every day. Won\\'t it be\\nfun to see them in print, and shan\\'t we feel proud of our authoress?\"\\n\\nJo\\'s eyes sparkled, for it is always pleasant to be believed in, and a\\nfriend\\'s praise is always sweeter than a dozen newspaper puffs.\\n\\n\"Where\\'s your secret?  Play fair, Teddy, or I\\'ll never believe you\\nagain,\" she said, trying to extinguish the brilliant hopes that blazed\\nup at a word of encouragement.\\n\\n\"I may get into a scrape for telling, but I didn\\'t promise not to, so I\\nwill, for I never feel easy in my mind till I\\'ve told you any plummy\\nbit of news I get.  I know where Meg\\'s glove is.\"\\n\\n\"Is that all?\" said Jo, looking disappointed, as Laurie nodded and\\ntwinkled with a face full of mysterious intelligence.\\n\\n\"It\\'s quite enough for the present, as you\\'ll agree when I tell you\\nwhere it is.\"\\n\\n\"Tell, then.\"\\n\\nLaurie bent, and whispered three words in Jo\\'s ear, which produced a\\ncomical change.  She stood and stared at him for a minute, looking both\\nsurprised and displeased, then walked on, saying sharply, \"How do you\\nknow?\"\\n\\n\"Saw it.\"\\n\\n\"Where?\"\\n\\n\"Pocket.\"\\n\\n\"All this time?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, isn\\'t that romantic?\"\\n\\n\"No, it\\'s horrid.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you like it?\"\\n\\n\"Of course I don\\'t.  It\\'s ridiculous, it won\\'t be allowed.  My\\npatience!  What would Meg say?\"\\n\\n\"You are not to tell anyone.  Mind that.\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t promise.\"\\n\\n\"That was understood, and I trusted you.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I won\\'t for the present, anyway, but I\\'m disgusted, and wish you\\nhadn\\'t told me.\"\\n\\n\"I thought you\\'d be pleased.\"\\n\\n\"At the idea of anybody coming to take Meg away? No, thank you.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll feel better about it when somebody comes to take you away.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d like to see anyone try it,\" cried Jo fiercely.\\n\\n\"So should I!\" and Laurie chuckled at the idea.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think secrets agree with me, I feel rumpled up in my mind\\nsince you told me that,\" said Jo rather ungratefully.\\n\\n\"Race down this hill with me, and you\\'ll be all right,\" suggested\\nLaurie.\\n\\nNo one was in sight, the smooth road sloped invitingly before her, and\\nfinding the temptation irresistible, Jo darted away, soon leaving hat\\nand comb behind her and scattering hairpins as she ran. Laurie reached\\nthe goal first and was quite satisfied with the success of his\\ntreatment, for his Atlanta came panting up with flying hair, bright\\neyes, ruddy cheeks, and no signs of dissatisfaction in her face.\\n\\n\"I wish I was a horse, then I could run for miles in this splendid air,\\nand not lose my breath.  It was capital, but see what a guy it\\'s made\\nme.  Go, pick up my things, like a cherub, as you are,\" said Jo,\\ndropping down under a maple tree, which was carpeting the bank with\\ncrimson leaves.\\n\\nLaurie leisurely departed to recover the lost property, and Jo bundled\\nup her braids, hoping no one would pass by till she was tidy again.\\nBut someone did pass, and who should it be but Meg, looking\\nparticularly ladylike in her state and festival suit, for she had been\\nmaking calls.\\n\\n\"What in the world are you doing here?\" she asked, regarding her\\ndisheveled sister with well-bred surprise.\\n\\n\"Getting leaves,\" meekly answered Jo, sorting the rosy handful she had\\njust swept up.\\n\\n\"And hairpins,\" added Laurie, throwing half a dozen into Jo\\'s lap.\\n\"They grow on this road, Meg, so do combs and brown straw hats.\"\\n\\n\"You have been running, Jo.  How could you?  When will you stop such\\nromping ways?\" said Meg reprovingly, as she settled her cuffs and\\nsmoothed her hair, with which the wind had taken liberties.\\n\\n\"Never till I\\'m stiff and old and have to use a crutch.  Don\\'t try to\\nmake me grow up before my time, Meg.  It\\'s hard enough to have you\\nchange all of a sudden.  Let me be a little girl as long as I can.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke, Jo bent over the leaves to hide the trembling of her\\nlips, for lately she had felt that Margaret was fast getting to be a\\nwoman, and Laurie\\'s secret made her dread the separation which must\\nsurely come some time and now seemed very near.  He saw the trouble in\\nher face and drew Meg\\'s attention from it by asking quickly, \"Where\\nhave you been calling, all so fine?\"\\n\\n\"At the Gardiners\\', and Sallie has been telling me all about Belle\\nMoffat\\'s wedding.  It was very splendid, and they have gone to spend\\nthe winter in Paris.  Just think how delightful that must be!\"\\n\\n\"Do you envy her, Meg?\" said Laurie.\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid I do.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad of it!\" muttered Jo, tying on her hat with a jerk.\\n\\n\"Why?\" asked Meg, looking surprised.\\n\\n\"Because if you care much about riches, you will never go and marry a\\npoor man,\" said Jo, frowning at Laurie, who was mutely warning her to\\nmind what she said.\\n\\n\"I shall never \\'_go_ and marry\\' anyone,\" observed Meg, walking on with\\ngreat dignity while the others followed, laughing, whispering, skipping\\nstones, and \\'behaving like children\\', as Meg said to herself, though\\nshe might have been tempted to join them if she had not had her best\\ndress on.\\n\\nFor a week or two, Jo behaved so queerly that her sisters were quite\\nbewildered.  She rushed to the door when the postman rang, was rude to\\nMr. Brooke whenever they met, would sit looking at Meg with a\\nwoe-begone face, occasionally jumping up to shake and then kiss her in\\na very mysterious manner.  Laurie and she were always making signs to\\none another, and talking about \\'Spread Eagles\\' till the girls declared\\nthey had both lost their wits.  On the second Saturday after Jo got out\\nof the window, Meg, as she sat sewing at her window, was scandalized by\\nthe sight of Laurie chasing Jo all over the garden and finally\\ncapturing her in Amy\\'s bower.  What went on there, Meg could not see,\\nbut shrieks of laughter were heard, followed by the murmur of voices\\nand a great flapping of newspapers.\\n\\n\"What shall we do with that girl?  She never _will_ behave like a young\\nlady,\" sighed Meg, as she watched the race with a disapproving face.\\n\\n\"I hope she won\\'t.  She is so funny and dear as she is,\" said Beth, who\\nhad never betrayed that she was a little hurt at Jo\\'s having secrets\\nwith anyone but her.\\n\\n\"It\\'s very trying, but we never can make her _commy la fo_,\" added Amy,\\nwho sat making some new frills for herself, with her curls tied up in a\\nvery becoming way, two agreeable things that made her feel unusually\\nelegant and ladylike.\\n\\nIn a few minutes Jo bounced in, laid herself on the sofa, and affected\\nto read.\\n\\n\"Have you anything interesting there?\" asked Meg, with condescension.\\n\\n\"Nothing but a story, won\\'t amount to much, I guess,\" returned Jo,\\ncarefully keeping the name of the paper out of sight.\\n\\n\"You\\'d better read it aloud.  That will amuse us and keep you out of\\nmischief,\" said Amy in her most grown-up tone.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the name?\" asked Beth, wondering why Jo kept her face behind\\nthe sheet.\\n\\n\"The Rival Painters.\"\\n\\n\"That sounds well.  Read it,\" said Meg.\\n\\nWith a loud \"Hem!\" and a long breath, Jo began to read very fast.  The\\ngirls listened with interest, for the tale was romantic, and somewhat\\npathetic, as most of the characters died in the end. \"I like that about\\nthe splendid picture,\" was Amy\\'s approving remark, as Jo paused.\\n\\n\"I prefer the lovering part.  Viola and Angelo are two of our favorite\\nnames, isn\\'t that queer?\" said Meg, wiping her eyes, for the lovering\\npart was tragical.\\n\\n\"Who wrote it?\" asked Beth, who had caught a glimpse of Jo\\'s face.\\n\\nThe reader suddenly sat up, cast away the paper, displaying a flushed\\ncountenance, and with a funny mixture of solemnity and excitement\\nreplied in a loud voice, \"Your sister.\"\\n\\n\"You?\" cried Meg, dropping her work.\\n\\n\"It\\'s very good,\" said Amy critically.\\n\\n\"I knew it!  I knew it! Oh, my Jo, I am so proud!\"  and Beth ran to hug\\nher sister and exult over this splendid success.\\n\\nDear me, how delighted they all were, to be sure!  How Meg wouldn\\'t\\nbelieve it till she saw the words.  \"Miss Josephine March,\" actually\\nprinted in the paper.  How graciously Amy criticized the artistic parts\\nof the story, and offered hints for a sequel, which unfortunately\\ncouldn\\'t be carried out, as the hero and heroine were dead.  How Beth\\ngot excited, and skipped and sang with joy.  How Hannah came in to\\nexclaim, \"Sakes alive, well I never!\" in great astonishment at \\'that\\nJo\\'s doin\\'s\\'.  How proud Mrs. March was when she knew it.  How Jo\\nlaughed, with tears in her eyes, as she declared she might as well be a\\npeacock and done with it, and how the \\'Spread Eagle\\' might be said to\\nflap his wings triumphantly over the House of March, as the paper\\npassed from hand to hand.\\n\\n\"Tell us about it.\"  \"When did it come?\" \"How much did you get for it?\"\\n\"What will Father say?\" \"Won\\'t Laurie laugh?\" cried the family, all in\\none breath as they clustered about Jo, for these foolish, affectionate\\npeople made a jubilee of every little household joy.\\n\\n\"Stop jabbering, girls, and I\\'ll tell you everything,\" said Jo,\\nwondering if Miss Burney felt any grander over her Evelina than she did\\nover her \\'Rival Painters\\'.  Having told how she disposed of her tales,\\nJo added, \"And when I went to get my answer, the man said he liked them\\nboth, but didn\\'t pay beginners, only let them print in his paper, and\\nnoticed the stories.  It was good practice, he said, and when the\\nbeginners improved, anyone would pay.  So I let him have the two\\nstories, and today this was sent to me, and Laurie caught me with it\\nand insisted on seeing it, so I let him.  And he said it was good, and\\nI shall write more, and he\\'s going to get the next paid for, and I am\\nso happy, for in time I may be able to support myself and help the\\ngirls.\"\\n\\nJo\\'s breath gave out here, and wrapping her head in the paper, she\\nbedewed her little story with a few natural tears, for to be\\nindependent and earn the praise of those she loved were the dearest\\nwishes of her heart, and this seemed to be the first step toward that\\nhappy end.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'FIFTEEN\\n\\nA TELEGRAM\\n\\n\"November is the most disagreeable month in the whole year,\" said\\nMargaret, standing at the window one dull afternoon, looking out at the\\nfrostbitten garden.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the reason I was born in it,\" observed Jo pensively, quite\\nunconscious of the blot on her nose.\\n\\n\"If something very pleasant should happen now, we should think it a\\ndelightful month,\" said Beth, who took a hopeful view of everything,\\neven November.\\n\\n\"I dare say, but nothing pleasant ever does happen in this family,\"\\nsaid Meg, who was out of sorts.  \"We go grubbing along day after day,\\nwithout a bit of change, and very little fun.  We might as well be in a\\ntreadmill.\"\\n\\n\"My patience, how blue we are!\" cried Jo.  \"I don\\'t much wonder, poor\\ndear, for you see other girls having splendid times, while you grind,\\ngrind, year in and year out.  Oh, don\\'t I wish I could manage things\\nfor you as I do for my heroines!  You\\'re pretty enough and good enough\\nalready, so I\\'d have some rich relation leave you a fortune\\nunexpectedly.  Then you\\'d dash out as an heiress, scorn everyone who\\nhas slighted you, go abroad, and come home my Lady Something in a blaze\\nof splendor and elegance.\"\\n\\n\"People don\\'t have fortunes left them in that style nowadays, men have\\nto work and women marry for money.  It\\'s a dreadfully unjust world,\"\\nsaid Meg bitterly.\\n\\n\"Jo and I are going to make fortunes for you all.  Just wait ten years,\\nand see if we don\\'t,\" said Amy, who sat in a corner making mud pies, as\\nHannah called her little clay models of birds, fruit, and faces.\\n\\n\"Can\\'t wait, and I\\'m afraid I haven\\'t much faith in ink and dirt,\\nthough I\\'m grateful for your good intentions.\"\\n\\nMeg sighed, and turned to the frostbitten garden again.  Jo groaned and\\nleaned both elbows on the table in a despondent attitude, but Amy\\nspatted away energetically, and Beth, who sat at the other window,\\nsaid, smiling, \"Two pleasant things are going to happen right away.\\nMarmee is coming down the street, and Laurie is tramping through the\\ngarden as if he had something nice to tell.\"\\n\\nIn they both came, Mrs. March with her usual question, \"Any letter from\\nFather, girls?\" and Laurie to say in his persuasive way, \"Won\\'t some of\\nyou come for a drive?  I\\'ve been working away at mathematics till my\\nhead is in a muddle, and I\\'m going to freshen my wits by a brisk turn.\\nIt\\'s a dull day, but the air isn\\'t bad, and I\\'m going to take Brooke\\nhome, so it will be gay inside, if it isn\\'t out.  Come, Jo, you and\\nBeth will go, won\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Of course we will.\"\\n\\n\"Much obliged, but I\\'m busy.\"  And Meg whisked out her workbasket, for\\nshe had agreed with her mother that it was best, for her at least, not\\nto drive too often with the young gentleman.\\n\\n\"We three will be ready in a minute,\" cried Amy, running away to wash\\nher hands.\\n\\n\"Can I do anything for you, Madam Mother?\" asked Laurie, leaning over\\nMrs. March\\'s chair with the affectionate look and tone he always gave\\nher.\\n\\n\"No, thank you, except call at the office, if you\\'ll be so kind, dear.\\nIt\\'s our day for a letter, and the postman hasn\\'t been.  Father is as\\nregular as the sun, but there\\'s some delay on the way, perhaps.\"\\n\\nA sharp ring interrupted her, and a minute after Hannah came in with a\\nletter.\\n\\n\"It\\'s one of them horrid telegraph things, mum,\" she said, handling it\\nas if she was afraid it would explode and do some damage.\\n\\nAt the word \\'telegraph\\', Mrs. March snatched it, read the two lines it\\ncontained, and dropped back into her chair as white as if the little\\npaper had sent a bullet to her heart.  Laurie dashed downstairs for\\nwater, while Meg and Hannah supported her, and Jo read aloud, in a\\nfrightened voice...\\n\\n    Mrs. March:\\n    Your husband is very ill.  Come at once.\\n    S.  HALE\\n    Blank Hospital, Washington.\\n\\nHow still the room was as they listened breathlessly, how strangely the\\nday darkened outside, and how suddenly the whole world seemed to\\nchange, as the girls gathered about their mother, feeling as if all the\\nhappiness and support of their lives was about to be taken from them.\\n\\nMrs. March was herself again directly, read the message over, and\\nstretched out her arms to her daughters, saying, in a tone they never\\nforgot, \"I shall go at once, but it may be too late.  Oh, children,\\nchildren, help me to bear it!\"\\n\\nFor several minutes there was nothing but the sound of sobbing in the\\nroom, mingled with broken words of comfort, tender assurances of help,\\nand hopeful whispers that died away in tears.  Poor Hannah was the\\nfirst to recover, and with unconscious wisdom she set all the rest a\\ngood example, for with her, work was panacea for most afflictions.\\n\\n\"The Lord keep the dear man!  I won\\'t waste no time a-cryin\\', but git\\nyour things ready right away, mum,\" she said heartily, as she wiped her\\nface on her apron, gave her mistress a warm shake of the hand with her\\nown hard one, and went away to work like three women in one.\\n\\n\"She\\'s right, there\\'s no time for tears now.  Be calm, girls, and let\\nme think.\"\\n\\nThey tried to be calm, poor things, as their mother sat up, looking\\npale but steady, and put away her grief to think and plan for them.\\n\\n\"Where\\'s Laurie?\" she asked presently, when she had collected her\\nthoughts and decided on the first duties to be done.\\n\\n\"Here, ma\\'am.  Oh, let me do something!\" cried the boy, hurrying from\\nthe next room whither he had withdrawn, feeling that their first sorrow\\nwas too sacred for even his friendly eyes to see.\\n\\n\"Send a telegram saying I will come at once.  The next train goes early\\nin the morning.  I\\'ll take that.\"\\n\\n\"What else?  The horses are ready.  I can go anywhere, do anything,\" he\\nsaid, looking ready to fly to the ends of the earth.\\n\\n\"Leave a note at Aunt March\\'s.  Jo, give me that pen and paper.\"\\n\\nTearing off the blank side of one of her newly copied pages, Jo drew\\nthe table before her mother, well knowing that money for the long, sad\\njourney must be borrowed, and feeling as if she could do anything to\\nadd a little to the sum for her father.\\n\\n\"Now go, dear, but don\\'t kill yourself driving at a desperate pace.\\nThere is no need of that.\"\\n\\nMrs. March\\'s warning was evidently thrown away, for five minutes later\\nLaurie tore by the window on his own fleet horse, riding as if for his\\nlife.\\n\\n\"Jo, run to the rooms, and tell Mrs. King that I can\\'t come. On the way\\nget these things.  I\\'ll put them down, they\\'ll be needed and I must go\\nprepared for nursing.  Hospital stores are not always good.  Beth, go\\nand ask Mr. Laurence for a couple of bottles of old wine.  I\\'m not too\\nproud to beg for Father.  He shall have the best of everything.  Amy,\\ntell Hannah to get down the black trunk, and Meg, come and help me find\\nmy things, for I\\'m half bewildered.\"\\n\\nWriting, thinking, and directing all at once might well bewilder the\\npoor lady, and Meg begged her to sit quietly in her room for a little\\nwhile, and let them work.  Everyone scattered like leaves before a gust\\nof wind, and the quiet, happy household was broken up as suddenly as if\\nthe paper had been an evil spell.\\n\\nMr. Laurence came hurrying back with Beth, bringing every comfort the\\nkind old gentleman could think of for the invalid, and friendliest\\npromises of protection for the girls during the mother\\'s absence, which\\ncomforted her very much.  There was nothing he didn\\'t offer, from his\\nown dressing gown to himself as escort.  But the last was impossible.\\nMrs. March would not hear of the old gentleman\\'s undertaking the long\\njourney, yet an expression of relief was visible when he spoke of it,\\nfor anxiety ill fits one for traveling. He saw the look, knit his heavy\\neyebrows, rubbed his hands, and marched abruptly away, saying he\\'d be\\nback directly.  No one had time to think of him again till, as Meg ran\\nthrough the entry, with a pair of rubbers in one hand and a cup of tea\\nin the other, she came suddenly upon Mr. Brooke.\\n\\n\"I\\'m very sorry to hear of this, Miss March,\" he said, in the kind,\\nquiet tone which sounded very pleasantly to her perturbed spirit.  \"I\\ncame to offer myself as escort to your mother.  Mr. Laurence has\\ncommissions for me in Washington, and it will give me real satisfaction\\nto be of service to her there.\"\\n\\nDown dropped the rubbers, and the tea was very near following, as Meg\\nput out her hand, with a face so full of gratitude that Mr. Brooke\\nwould have felt repaid for a much greater sacrifice than the trifling\\none of time and comfort which he was about to take.\\n\\n\"How kind you all are!  Mother will accept, I\\'m sure, and it will be\\nsuch a relief to know that she has someone to take care of her.  Thank\\nyou very, very much!\"\\n\\nMeg spoke earnestly, and forgot herself entirely till something in the\\nbrown eyes looking down at her made her remember the cooling tea, and\\nlead the way into the parlor, saying she would call her mother.\\n\\nEverything was arranged by the time Laurie returned with a note from\\nAunt March, enclosing the desired sum, and a few lines repeating what\\nshe had often said before, that she had always told them it was absurd\\nfor March to go into the army, always predicted that no good would come\\nof it, and she hoped they would take her advice the next time.  Mrs.\\nMarch put the note in the fire, the money in her purse, and went on\\nwith her preparations, with her lips folded tightly in a way which Jo\\nwould have understood if she had been there.\\n\\nThe short afternoon wore away.  All other errands were done, and Meg\\nand her mother busy at some necessary needlework, while Beth and Amy\\ngot tea, and Hannah finished her ironing with what she called a \\'slap\\nand a bang\\', but still Jo did not come.  They began to get anxious, and\\nLaurie went off to find her, for no one knew what freak Jo might take\\ninto her head.  He missed her, however, and she came walking in with a\\nvery queer expression of countenance, for there was a mixture of fun\\nand fear, satisfaction and regret in it, which puzzled the family as\\nmuch as did the roll of bills she laid before her mother, saying with a\\nlittle choke in her voice, \"That\\'s my contribution toward making Father\\ncomfortable and bringing him home!\"\\n\\n\"My dear, where did you get it?  Twenty-five dollars!  Jo, I hope you\\nhaven\\'t done anything rash?\"\\n\\n\"No, it\\'s mine honestly.  I didn\\'t beg, borrow, or steal it.  I earned\\nit, and I don\\'t think you\\'ll blame me, for I only sold what was my own.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke, Jo took off her bonnet, and a general outcry arose, for\\nall her abundant hair was cut short.\\n\\n\"Your hair!  Your beautiful hair!\"  \"Oh, Jo, how could you? Your one\\nbeauty.\"  \"My dear girl, there was no need of this.\"  \"She doesn\\'t look\\nlike my Jo any more, but I love her dearly for it!\"\\n\\nAs everyone exclaimed, and Beth hugged the cropped head tenderly, Jo\\nassumed an indifferent air, which did not deceive anyone a particle,\\nand said, rumpling up the brown bush and trying to look as if she liked\\nit, \"It doesn\\'t affect the fate of the nation, so don\\'t wail, Beth.  It\\nwill be good for my vanity, I was getting too proud of my wig.  It will\\ndo my brains good to have that mop taken off.  My head feels\\ndeliciously light and cool, and the barber said I could soon have a\\ncurly crop, which will be boyish, becoming, and easy to keep in order.\\nI\\'m satisfied, so please take the money and let\\'s have supper.\"\\n\\n\"Tell me all about it, Jo.  I am not quite satisfied, but I can\\'t blame\\nyou, for I know how willingly you sacrificed your vanity, as you call\\nit, to your love.  But, my dear, it was not necessary, and I\\'m afraid\\nyou will regret it one of these days,\" said Mrs. March.\\n\\n\"No, I won\\'t!\" returned Jo stoutly, feeling much relieved that her\\nprank was not entirely condemned.\\n\\n\"What made you do it?\" asked Amy, who would as soon have thought of\\ncutting off her head as her pretty hair.\\n\\n\"Well, I was wild to do something for Father,\" replied Jo, as they\\ngathered about the table, for healthy young people can eat even in the\\nmidst of trouble.  \"I hate to borrow as much as Mother does, and I knew\\nAunt March would croak, she always does, if you ask for a ninepence.\\nMeg gave all her quarterly salary toward the rent, and I only got some\\nclothes with mine, so I felt wicked, and was bound to have some money,\\nif I sold the nose off my face to get it.\"\\n\\n\"You needn\\'t feel wicked, my child! You had no winter things and got\\nthe simplest with your own hard earnings,\" said Mrs. March with a look\\nthat warmed Jo\\'s heart.\\n\\n\"I hadn\\'t the least idea of selling my hair at first, but as I went\\nalong I kept thinking what I could do, and feeling as if I\\'d like to\\ndive into some of the rich stores and help myself.  In a barber\\'s\\nwindow I saw tails of hair with the prices marked, and one black tail,\\nnot so thick as mine, was forty dollars.  It came to me all of a sudden\\nthat I had one thing to make money out of, and without stopping to\\nthink, I walked in, asked if they bought hair, and what they would give\\nfor mine.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t see how you dared to do it,\" said Beth in a tone of awe.\\n\\n\"Oh, he was a little man who looked as if he merely lived to oil his\\nhair.  He rather stared at first, as if he wasn\\'t used to having girls\\nbounce into his shop and ask him to buy their hair.  He said he didn\\'t\\ncare about mine, it wasn\\'t the fashionable color, and he never paid\\nmuch for it in the first place.  The work put into it made it dear, and\\nso on.  It was getting late, and I was afraid if it wasn\\'t done right\\naway that I shouldn\\'t have it done at all, and you know when I start to\\ndo a thing, I hate to give it up.  So I begged him to take it, and told\\nhim why I was in such a hurry.  It was silly, I dare say, but it\\nchanged his mind, for I got rather excited, and told the story in my\\ntopsy-turvy way, and his wife heard, and said so kindly, \\'Take it,\\nThomas, and oblige the young lady.  I\\'d do as much for our Jimmy any\\nday if I had a spire of hair worth selling.\"\\n\\n\"Who was Jimmy?\" asked Amy, who liked to have things explained as they\\nwent along.\\n\\n\"Her son, she said, who was in the army.  How friendly such things make\\nstrangers feel, don\\'t they?  She talked away all the time the man\\nclipped, and diverted my mind nicely.\"\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t you feel dreadfully when the first cut came?\" asked Meg, with a\\nshiver.\\n\\n\"I took a last look at my hair while the man got his things, and that\\nwas the end of it.  I never snivel over trifles like that. I will\\nconfess, though, I felt queer when I saw the dear old hair laid out on\\nthe table, and felt only the short rough ends of my head. It almost\\nseemed as if I\\'d an arm or leg off.  The woman saw me look at it, and\\npicked out a long lock for me to keep.  I\\'ll give it to you, Marmee,\\njust to remember past glories by, for a crop is so comfortable I don\\'t\\nthink I shall ever have a mane again.\"\\n\\nMrs. March folded the wavy chestnut lock, and laid it away with a short\\ngray one in her desk.  She only said, \"Thank you, deary,\" but something\\nin her face made the girls change the subject, and talk as cheerfully\\nas they could about Mr. Brooke\\'s kindness, the prospect of a fine day\\ntomorrow, and the happy times they would have when Father came home to\\nbe nursed.\\n\\nNo one wanted to go to bed when at ten o\\'clock Mrs. March put by the\\nlast finished job, and said, \"Come girls.\"  Beth went to the piano and\\nplayed the father\\'s favorite hymn.  All began bravely, but broke down\\none by one till Beth was left alone, singing with all her heart, for to\\nher music was always a sweet consoler.\\n\\n\"Go to bed and don\\'t talk, for we must be up early and shall need all\\nthe sleep we can get.  Good night, my darlings,\" said Mrs. March, as\\nthe hymn ended, for no one cared to try another.\\n\\nThey kissed her quietly, and went to bed as silently as if the dear\\ninvalid lay in the next room.  Beth and Amy soon fell asleep in spite\\nof the great trouble, but Meg lay awake, thinking the most serious\\nthoughts she had ever known in her short life.  Jo lay motionless, and\\nher sister fancied that she was asleep, till a stifled sob made her\\nexclaim, as she touched a wet cheek...\\n\\n\"Jo, dear, what is it?  Are you crying about father?\"\\n\\n\"No, not now.\"\\n\\n\"What then?\"\\n\\n\"My... My hair!\" burst out poor Jo, trying vainly to smother her\\nemotion in the pillow.\\n\\nIt did not seem at all comical to Meg, who kissed and caressed the\\nafflicted heroine in the tenderest manner.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not sorry,\" protested Jo, with a choke.  \"I\\'d do it again\\ntomorrow, if I could.  It\\'s only the vain part of me that goes and\\ncries in this silly way.  Don\\'t tell anyone, it\\'s all over now.  I\\nthought you were asleep, so I just made a little private moan for my\\none beauty.  How came you to be awake?\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t sleep, I\\'m so anxious,\" said Meg.\\n\\n\"Think about something pleasant, and you\\'ll soon drop off.\"\\n\\n\"I tried it, but felt wider awake than ever.\"\\n\\n\"What did you think of?\"\\n\\n\"Handsome faces--eyes particularly,\" answered Meg, smiling to herself\\nin the dark.\\n\\n\"What color do you like best?\"\\n\\n\"Brown, that is, sometimes.  Blue are lovely.\"\\n\\nJo laughed, and Meg sharply ordered her not to talk, then amiably\\npromised to make her hair curl, and fell asleep to dream of living in\\nher castle in the air.\\n\\nThe clocks were striking midnight and the rooms were very still as a\\nfigure glided quietly from bed to bed, smoothing a coverlet here,\\nsettling a pillow there, and pausing to look long and tenderly at each\\nunconscious face, to kiss each with lips that mutely blessed, and to\\npray the fervent prayers which only mothers utter.  As she lifted the\\ncurtain to look out into the dreary night, the moon broke suddenly from\\nbehind the clouds and shone upon her like a bright, benignant face,\\nwhich seemed to whisper in the silence, \"Be comforted, dear soul!\\nThere is always light behind the clouds.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'SIXTEEN\\n\\nLETTERS\\n\\nIn the cold gray dawn the sisters lit their lamp and read their chapter\\nwith an earnestness never felt before.  For now the shadow of a real\\ntrouble had come, the little books were full of help and comfort, and\\nas they dressed, they agreed to say goodbye cheerfully and hopefully,\\nand send their mother on her anxious journey unsaddened by tears or\\ncomplaints from them.  Everything seemed very strange when they went\\ndown, so dim and still outside, so full of light and bustle within.\\nBreakfast at that early hour seemed odd, and even Hannah\\'s familiar\\nface looked unnatural as she flew about her kitchen with her nightcap\\non.  The big trunk stood ready in the hall, Mother\\'s cloak and bonnet\\nlay on the sofa, and Mother herself sat trying to eat, but looking so\\npale and worn with sleeplessness and anxiety that the girls found it\\nvery hard to keep their resolution.  Meg\\'s eyes kept filling in spite\\nof herself, Jo was obliged to hide her face in the kitchen roller more\\nthan once, and the little girls wore a grave, troubled expression, as\\nif sorrow was a new experience to them.\\n\\nNobody talked much, but as the time drew very near and they sat waiting\\nfor the carriage, Mrs. March said to the girls, who were all busied\\nabout her, one folding her shawl, another smoothing out the strings of\\nher bonnet, a third putting on her overshoes, and a fourth fastening up\\nher travelling bag...\\n\\n\"Children, I leave you to Hannah\\'s care and Mr. Laurence\\'s protection.\\nHannah is faithfulness itself, and our good neighbor will guard you as\\nif you were his own.  I have no fears for you, yet I am anxious that\\nyou should take this trouble rightly.  Don\\'t grieve and fret when I am\\ngone, or think that you can be idle and comfort yourselves by being\\nidle and trying to forget.  Go on with your work as usual, for work is\\na blessed solace.  Hope and keep busy, and whatever happens, remember\\nthat you never can be fatherless.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Mother.\"\\n\\n\"Meg, dear, be prudent, watch over your sisters, consult Hannah, and in\\nany perplexity, go to Mr. Laurence.  Be patient, Jo, don\\'t get\\ndespondent or do rash things, write to me often, and be my brave girl,\\nready to help and cheer all.  Beth, comfort yourself with your music,\\nand be faithful to the little home duties, and you, Amy, help all you\\ncan, be obedient, and keep happy safe at home.\"\\n\\n\"We will, Mother!  We will!\"\\n\\nThe rattle of an approaching carriage made them all start and listen.\\nThat was the hard minute, but the girls stood it well.  No one cried,\\nno one ran away or uttered a lamentation, though their hearts were very\\nheavy as they sent loving messages to Father, remembering, as they\\nspoke that it might be too late to deliver them. They kissed their\\nmother quietly, clung about her tenderly, and tried to wave their hands\\ncheerfully when she drove away.\\n\\nLaurie and his grandfather came over to see her off, and Mr. Brooke\\nlooked so strong and sensible and kind that the girls christened him\\n\\'Mr. Greatheart\\' on the spot.\\n\\n\"Good-by, my darlings!  God bless and keep us all!\" whispered Mrs.\\nMarch, as she kissed one dear little face after the other, and hurried\\ninto the carriage.\\n\\nAs she rolled away, the sun came out, and looking back, she saw it\\nshining on the group at the gate like a good omen.  They saw it also,\\nand smiled and waved their hands, and the last thing she beheld as she\\nturned the corner was the four bright faces, and behind them like a\\nbodyguard, old Mr. Laurence, faithful Hannah, and devoted Laurie.\\n\\n\"How kind everyone is to us!\" she said, turning to find fresh proof of\\nit in the respectful sympathy of the young man\\'s face.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t see how they can help it,\" returned Mr. Brooke, laughing so\\ninfectiously that Mrs. March could not help smiling. And so the journey\\nbegan with the good omens of sunshine, smiles, and cheerful words.\\n\\n\"I feel as if there had been an earthquake,\" said Jo, as their\\nneighbors went home to breakfast, leaving them to rest and refresh\\nthemselves.\\n\\n\"It seems as if half the house was gone,\" added Meg forlornly.\\n\\nBeth opened her lips to say something, but could only point to the pile\\nof nicely mended hose which lay on Mother\\'s table, showing that even in\\nher last hurried moments she had thought and worked for them.  It was a\\nlittle thing, but it went straight to their hearts, and in spite of\\ntheir brave resolutions, they all broke down and cried bitterly.\\n\\nHannah wisely allowed them to relieve their feelings, and when the\\nshower showed signs of clearing up, she came to the rescue, armed with\\na coffeepot.\\n\\n\"Now, my dear young ladies, remember what your ma said, and don\\'t fret.\\nCome and have a cup of coffee all round, and then let\\'s fall to work\\nand be a credit to the family.\"\\n\\nCoffee was a treat, and Hannah showed great tact in making it that\\nmorning.  No one could resist her persuasive nods, or the fragrant\\ninvitation issuing from the nose of the coffee pot.  They drew up to\\nthe table, exchanged their handkerchiefs for napkins, and in ten\\nminutes were all right again.\\n\\n\"\\'Hope and keep busy\\', that\\'s the motto for us, so let\\'s see who will\\nremember it best.  I shall go to Aunt March, as usual. Oh, won\\'t she\\nlecture though!\" said Jo, as she sipped with returning spirit.\\n\\n\"I shall go to my Kings, though I\\'d much rather stay at home and attend\\nto things here,\" said Meg, wishing she hadn\\'t made her eyes so red.\\n\\n\"No need of that.  Beth and I can keep house perfectly well,\" put in\\nAmy, with an important air.\\n\\n\"Hannah will tell us what to do, and we\\'ll have everything nice when\\nyou come home,\" added Beth, getting out her mop and dish tub without\\ndelay.\\n\\n\"I think anxiety is very interesting,\" observed Amy, eating sugar\\npensively.\\n\\nThe girls couldn\\'t help laughing, and felt better for it, though Meg\\nshook her head at the young lady who could find consolation in a sugar\\nbowl.\\n\\nThe sight of the turnovers made Jo sober again; and when the two went\\nout to their daily tasks, they looked sorrowfully back at the window\\nwhere they were accustomed to see their mother\\'s face.  It was gone,\\nbut Beth had remembered the little household ceremony, and there she\\nwas, nodding away at them like a rosyfaced mandarin.\\n\\n\"That\\'s so like my Beth!\" said Jo, waving her hat, with a grateful\\nface.  \"Goodbye, Meggy, I hope the Kings won\\'t strain today.  Don\\'t\\nfret about Father, dear,\" she added, as they parted.\\n\\n\"And I hope Aunt March won\\'t croak.  Your hair is becoming, and it\\nlooks very boyish and nice,\" returned Meg, trying not to smile at the\\ncurly head, which looked comically small on her tall sister\\'s shoulders.\\n\\n\"That\\'s my only comfort.\" And, touching her hat a la Laurie, away went\\nJo, feeling like a shorn sheep on a wintry day.\\n\\nNews from their father comforted the girls very much, for though\\ndangerously ill, the presence of the best and tenderest of nurses had\\nalready done him good.  Mr. Brooke sent a bulletin every day, and as\\nthe head of the family, Meg insisted on reading the dispatches, which\\ngrew more cheerful as the week passed.  At first, everyone was eager to\\nwrite, and plump envelopes were carefully poked into the letter box by\\none or other of the sisters, who felt rather important with their\\nWashington correspondence.  As one of these packets contained\\ncharacteristic notes from the party, we will rob an imaginary mail, and\\nread them.\\n\\nMy dearest Mother:\\n\\nIt is impossible to tell you how happy your last letter made us, for\\nthe news was so good we couldn\\'t help laughing and crying over it.  How\\nvery kind Mr. Brooke is, and how fortunate that Mr. Laurence\\'s business\\ndetains him near you so long, since he is so useful to you and Father.\\nThe girls are all as good as gold.  Jo helps me with the sewing, and\\ninsists on doing all sorts of hard jobs.  I should be afraid she might\\noverdo, if I didn\\'t know her \\'moral fit\\' wouldn\\'t last long.  Beth is\\nas regular about her tasks as a clock, and never forgets what you told\\nher.  She grieves about Father, and looks sober except when she is at\\nher little piano.  Amy minds me nicely, and I take great care of her.\\nShe does her own hair, and I am teaching her to make buttonholes and\\nmend her stockings. She tries very hard, and I know you will be pleased\\nwith her improvement when you come.  Mr. Laurence watches over us like\\na motherly old hen, as Jo says, and Laurie is very kind and neighborly.\\nHe and Jo keep us merry, for we get pretty blue sometimes, and feel\\nlike orphans, with you so far away.  Hannah is a perfect saint.  She\\ndoes not scold at all, and always calls me Miss Margaret, which is\\nquite proper, you know, and treats me with respect.  We are all well\\nand busy, but we long, day and night, to have you back.  Give my\\ndearest love to Father, and believe me, ever your own...\\n\\nMEG\\n\\nThis note, prettily written on scented paper, was a great contrast to\\nthe next, which was scribbled on a big sheet of thin foreign paper,\\nornamented with blots and all manner of flourishes and curly-tailed\\nletters.\\n\\nMy precious Marmee:\\n\\nThree cheers for dear Father!  Brooke was a trump to telegraph right\\noff, and let us know the minute he was better.  I rushed up garret when\\nthe letter came, and tried to thank god for being so good to us, but I\\ncould only cry, and say, \"I\\'m glad!  I\\'m glad!\" Didn\\'t that do as well\\nas a regular prayer?  For I felt a great many in my heart.  We have\\nsuch funny times, and now I can enjoy them, for everyone is so\\ndesperately good, it\\'s like living in a nest of turtledoves.  You\\'d\\nlaugh to see Meg head the table and try to be motherish.  She gets\\nprettier every day, and I\\'m in love with her sometimes.  The children\\nare regular archangels, and I--well, I\\'m Jo, and never shall be\\nanything else.  Oh, I must tell you that I came near having a quarrel\\nwith Laurie.  I freed my mind about a silly little thing, and he was\\noffended.  I was right, but didn\\'t speak as I ought, and he marched\\nhome, saying he wouldn\\'t come again till I begged pardon.  I declared I\\nwouldn\\'t and got mad. It lasted all day.  I felt bad and wanted you\\nvery much.  Laurie and I are both so proud, it\\'s hard to beg pardon.\\nBut I thought he\\'d come to it, for I was in the right.  He didn\\'t come,\\nand just at night I remembered what you said when Amy fell into the\\nriver.  I read my little book, felt better, resolved not to let the sun\\nset on my anger, and ran over to tell Laurie I was sorry.  I met him at\\nthe gate, coming for the same thing.  We both laughed, begged each\\nother\\'s pardon, and felt all good and comfortable again.\\n\\nI made a \\'pome\\' yesterday, when I was helping Hannah wash, and as\\nFather likes my silly little things, I put it in to amuse him.  Give\\nhim my lovingest hug that ever was, and kiss yourself a dozen times for\\nyour...\\n\\nTOPSY-TURVY JO\\n\\n\\n    A SONG FROM THE SUDS\\n\\n    Queen of my tub, I merrily sing,\\n    While the white foam rises high,\\n    And sturdily wash and rinse and wring,\\n    And fasten the clothes to dry.\\n    Then out in the free fresh air they swing,\\n    Under the sunny sky.\\n\\n    I wish we could wash from our hearts and souls\\n    The stains of the week away,\\n    And let water and air by their magic make\\n    Ourselves as pure as they.\\n    Then on the earth there would be indeed,\\n    A glorious washing day!\\n\\n    Along the path of a useful life,\\n    Will heart\\'s-ease ever bloom.\\n    The busy mind has no time to think\\n    Of sorrow or care or gloom.\\n    And anxious thoughts may be swept away,\\n    As we bravely wield a broom.\\n\\n    I am glad a task to me is given,\\n    To labor at day by day,\\n    For it brings me health and strength and hope,\\n    And I cheerfully learn to say,\\n    \"Head, you may think, Heart, you may feel,\\n    But, Hand, you shall work alway!\"\\n\\n\\nDear Mother,\\n\\nThere is only room for me to send my love, and some pressed pansies\\nfrom the root I have been keeping safe in the house for Father to see.\\nI read every morning, try to be good all day, and sing myself to sleep\\nwith Father\\'s tune.  I can\\'t sing \\'LAND OF THE LEAL\\' now, it makes me\\ncry.  Everyone is very kind, and we are as happy as we can be without\\nyou.  Amy wants the rest of the page, so I must stop.

       " 'SEVENTEEN\\n\\nLITTLE FAITHFUL\\n\\nFor a week the amount of virtue in the old house would have supplied\\nthe neighborhood.  It was really amazing, for everyone seemed in a\\nheavenly frame of mind, and self-denial was all the fashion.  Relieved\\nof their first anxiety about their father, the girls insensibly relaxed\\ntheir praiseworthy efforts a little, and began to fall back into old\\nways.  They did not forget their motto, but hoping and keeping busy\\nseemed to grow easier, and after such tremendous exertions, they felt\\nthat Endeavor deserved a holiday, and gave it a good many.\\n\\nJo caught a bad cold through neglect to cover the shorn head enough,\\nand was ordered to stay at home till she was better, for Aunt March\\ndidn\\'t like to hear people read with colds in their heads.  Jo liked\\nthis, and after an energetic rummage from garret to cellar, subsided on\\nthe sofa to nurse her cold with arsenicum and books.  Amy found that\\nhousework and art did not go well together, and returned to her mud\\npies.  Meg went daily to her pupils, and sewed, or thought she did, at\\nhome, but much time was spent in writing long letters to her mother, or\\nreading the Washington dispatches over and over.  Beth kept on, with\\nonly slight relapses into idleness or grieving.\\n\\nAll the little duties were faithfully done each day, and many of her\\nsisters\\' also, for they were forgetful, and the house seemed like a\\nclock whose pendulum was gone a-visiting.  When her heart got heavy\\nwith longings for Mother or fears for Father, she went away into a\\ncertain closet, hid her face in the folds of a dear old gown, and made\\nher little moan and prayed her little prayer quietly by herself.\\nNobody knew what cheered her up after a sober fit, but everyone felt\\nhow sweet and helpful Beth was, and fell into a way of going to her for\\ncomfort or advice in their small affairs.\\n\\nAll were unconscious that this experience was a test of character, and\\nwhen the first excitement was over, felt that they had done well and\\ndeserved praise.  So they did, but their mistake was in ceasing to do\\nwell, and they learned this lesson through much anxiety and regret.\\n\\n\"Meg, I wish you\\'d go and see the Hummels.  You know Mother told us not\\nto forget them.\" said Beth, ten days after Mrs. March\\'s departure.\\n\\n\"I\\'m too tired to go this afternoon,\" replied Meg, rocking comfortably\\nas she sewed.\\n\\n\"Can\\'t you, Jo?\" asked Beth.\\n\\n\"Too stormy for me with my cold.\"\\n\\n\"I thought it was almost well.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s well enough for me to go out with Laurie, but not well enough to\\ngo to the Hummels\\',\" said Jo, laughing, but looking a little ashamed of\\nher inconsistency.\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you go yourself?\" asked Meg.\\n\\n\"I have been every day, but the baby is sick, and I don\\'t know what to\\ndo for it.  Mrs. Hummel goes away to work, and Lottchen takes care of\\nit.  But it gets sicker and sicker, and I think you or Hannah ought to\\ngo.\"\\n\\nBeth spoke earnestly, and Meg promised she would go tomorrow.\\n\\n\"Ask Hannah for some nice little mess, and take it round, Beth, the air\\nwill do you good,\" said Jo, adding apologetically, \"I\\'d go but I want\\nto finish my writing.\"\\n\\n\"My head aches and I\\'m tired, so I thought maybe some of you would go,\"\\nsaid Beth.\\n\\n\"Amy will be in presently, and she will run down for us,\" suggested Meg.\\n\\nSo Beth lay down on the sofa, the others returned to their work, and\\nthe Hummels were forgotten.  An hour passed.  Amy did not come, Meg\\nwent to her room to try on a new dress, Jo was absorbed in her story,\\nand Hannah was sound asleep before the kitchen fire, when Beth quietly\\nput on her hood, filled her basket with odds and ends for the poor\\nchildren, and went out into the chilly air with a heavy head and a\\ngrieved look in her patient eyes.  It was late when she came back, and\\nno one saw her creep upstairs and shut herself into her mother\\'s room.\\nHalf an hour after, Jo went to \\'Mother\\'s closet\\' for something, and\\nthere found little Beth sitting on the medicine chest, looking very\\ngrave, with red eyes and a camphor bottle in her hand.\\n\\n\"Christopher Columbus!  What\\'s the matter?\" cried Jo, as Beth put out\\nher hand as if to warn her off, and asked quickly. . .\\n\\n\"You\\'ve had the scarlet fever, haven\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Years ago, when Meg did.  Why?\"\\n\\n\"Then I\\'ll tell you.  Oh, Jo, the baby\\'s dead!\"\\n\\n\"What baby?\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Hummel\\'s.  It died in my lap before she got home,\" cried Beth\\nwith a sob.\\n\\n\"My poor dear, how dreadful for you!  I ought to have gone,\" said Jo,\\ntaking her sister in her arms as she sat down in her mother\\'s big\\nchair, with a remorseful face.\\n\\n\"It wasn\\'t dreadful, Jo, only so sad!  I saw in a minute it was sicker,\\nbut Lottchen said her mother had gone for a doctor, so I took Baby and\\nlet Lotty rest.  It seemed asleep, but all of a sudden if gave a little\\ncry and trembled, and then lay very still. I tried to warm its feet,\\nand Lotty gave it some milk, but it didn\\'t stir, and I knew it was\\ndead.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t cry, dear!  What did you do?\"\\n\\n\"I just sat and held it softly till Mrs. Hummel came with the doctor.\\nHe said it was dead, and looked at Heinrich and Minna, who have sore\\nthroats.  \\'Scarlet fever, ma\\'am.  Ought to have called me before,\\' he\\nsaid crossly.  Mrs. Hummel told him she was poor, and had tried to cure\\nbaby herself, but now it was too late, and she could only ask him to\\nhelp the others and trust to charity for his pay.  He smiled then, and\\nwas kinder, but it was very sad, and I cried with them till he turned\\nround all of a sudden, and told me to go home and take belladonna right\\naway, or I\\'d have the fever.\"\\n\\n\"No, you won\\'t!\" cried Jo, hugging her close, with a frightened look.\\n\"Oh, Beth, if you should be sick I never could forgive myself! What\\nshall we do?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be frightened, I guess I shan\\'t have it badly.  I looked in\\nMother\\'s book, and saw that it begins with headache, sore throat, and\\nqueer feelings like mine, so I did take some belladonna, and I feel\\nbetter,\" said Beth, laying her cold hands on her hot forehead and\\ntrying to look well.\\n\\n\"If Mother was only at home!\" exclaimed Jo, seizing the book, and\\nfeeling that Washington was an immense way off.  She read a page,\\nlooked at Beth, felt her head, peeped into her throat, and then said\\ngravely, \"You\\'ve been over the baby every day for more than a week, and\\namong the others who are going to have it, so I\\'m afraid you are going\\nto have it, Beth.  I\\'ll call Hannah, she knows all about sickness.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t let Amy come.  She never had it, and I should hate to give it to\\nher.  Can\\'t you and Meg have it over again?\" asked Beth, anxiously.\\n\\n\"I guess not.  Don\\'t care if I do.  Serve me right, selfish pig, to let\\nyou go, and stay writing rubbish myself!\" muttered Jo, as she went to\\nconsult Hannah.\\n\\nThe good soul was wide awake in a minute, and took the lead at once,\\nassuring that there was no need to worry; every one had scarlet fever,\\nand if rightly treated, nobody died, all of which Jo believed, and felt\\nmuch relieved as they went up to call Meg.\\n\\n\"Now I\\'ll tell you what we\\'ll do,\" said Hannah, when she had examined\\nand questioned Beth, \"we will have Dr. Bangs, just to take a look at\\nyou, dear, and see that we start right.  Then we\\'ll send Amy off to\\nAunt March\\'s for a spell, to keep her out of harm\\'s way, and one of you\\ngirls can stay at home and amuse Beth for a day or two.\"\\n\\n\"I shall stay, of course, I\\'m oldest,\" began Meg, looking anxious and\\nself-reproachful.\\n\\n\"I shall, because it\\'s my fault she is sick.  I told Mother I\\'d do the\\nerrands, and I haven\\'t,\" said Jo decidedly.\\n\\n\"Which will you have, Beth?  There ain\\'t no need of but one,\" aid\\nHannah.\\n\\n\"Jo, please.\" And Beth leaned her head against her sister with a\\ncontented look, which effectually settled that point.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll go and tell Amy,\" said Meg, feeling a little hurt, yet rather\\nrelieved on the whole, for she did not like nursing, and Jo did.\\n\\nAmy rebelled outright, and passionately declared that she had rather\\nhave the fever than go to Aunt March.  Meg reasoned, pleaded, and\\ncommanded, all in vain.  Amy protested that she would not go, and Meg\\nleft her in despair to ask Hannah what should be done.  Before she came\\nback, Laurie walked into the parlor to find Amy sobbing, with her head\\nin the sofa cushions.  She told her story, expecting to be consoled,\\nbut Laurie only put his hands in his pockets and walked about the room,\\nwhistling softly, as he knit his brows in deep thought.  Presently he\\nsat down beside her, and said, in his most wheedlesome tone, \"Now be a\\nsensible little woman, and do as they say. No, don\\'t cry, but hear what\\na jolly plan I\\'ve got.  You go to Aunt March\\'s, and I\\'ll come and take\\nyou out every day, driving or walking, and we\\'ll have capital times.\\nWon\\'t that be better than moping here?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t wish to be sent off as if I was in the way,\" began Amy, in an\\ninjured voice.\\n\\n\"Bless your heart, child, it\\'s to keep you well.  You don\\'t want to be\\nsick, do you?\"\\n\\n\"No, I\\'m sure I don\\'t, but I dare say I shall be, for I\\'ve been with\\nBeth all the time.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s the very reason you ought to go away at once, so that you may\\nescape it.  Change of air and care will keep you well, I dare say, or\\nif it does not entirely, you will have the fever more lightly.  I\\nadvise you to be off as soon as you can, for scarlet fever is no joke,\\nmiss.\"\\n\\n\"But it\\'s dull at Aunt March\\'s, and she is so cross,\" said Amy, looking\\nrather frightened.\\n\\n\"It won\\'t be dull with me popping in every day to tell you how Beth is,\\nand take you out gallivanting.  The old lady likes me, and I\\'ll be as\\nsweet as possible to her, so she won\\'t peck at us, whatever we do.\"\\n\\n\"Will you take me out in the trotting wagon with Puck?\"\\n\\n\"On my honor as a gentleman.\"\\n\\n\"And come every single day?\"\\n\\n\"See if I don\\'t!\"\\n\\n\"And bring me back the minute Beth is well?\"\\n\\n\"The identical minute.\"\\n\\n\"And go to the theater, truly?\"\\n\\n\"A dozen theaters, if we may.\"\\n\\n\"Well--I guess I will,\" said Amy slowly.\\n\\n\"Good girl!  Call Meg, and tell her you\\'ll give in,\" said Laurie, with\\nan approving pat, which annoyed Amy more than the \\'giving in\\'.\\n\\nMeg and Jo came running down to behold the miracle which had been\\nwrought, and Amy, feeling very precious and self-sacrificing, promised\\nto go, if the doctor said Beth was going to be ill.\\n\\n\"How is the little dear?\" asked Laurie, for Beth was his especial pet,\\nand he felt more anxious about her than he liked to show.\\n\\n\"She is lying down on Mother\\'s bed, and feels better.  The baby\\'s death\\ntroubled her, but I dare say she has only got cold. Hannah says she\\nthinks so, but she looks worried, and that makes me fidgety,\" answered\\nMeg.\\n\\n\"What a trying world it is!\" said Jo, rumpling up her hair in a fretful\\nway.  \"No sooner do we get out of one trouble than down comes another.\\nThere doesn\\'t seem to be anything to hold on to when Mother\\'s gone, so\\nI\\'m all at sea.\"\\n\\n\"Well, don\\'t make a porcupine of yourself, it isn\\'t becoming. Settle\\nyour wig, Jo, and tell me if I shall telegraph to your mother, or do\\nanything?\" asked Laurie, who never had been reconciled to the loss of\\nhis friend\\'s one beauty.\\n\\n\"That is what troubles me,\" said Meg.  \"I think we ought to tell her if\\nBeth is really ill, but Hannah says we mustn\\'t, for Mother can\\'t leave\\nFather, and it will only make them anxious.  Beth won\\'t be sick long,\\nand Hannah knows just what to do, and Mother said we were to mind her,\\nso I suppose we must, but it doesn\\'t seem quite right to me.\"\\n\\n\"Hum, well, I can\\'t say.  Suppose you ask Grandfather after the doctor\\nhas been.\"\\n\\n\"We will.  Jo, go and get Dr. Bangs at once,\" commanded Meg. \"We can\\'t\\ndecide anything till he has been.\"\\n\\n\"Stay where you are, Jo.  I\\'m errand boy to this establishment,\" said\\nLaurie, taking up his cap.\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid you are busy,\" began Meg.\\n\\n\"No, I\\'ve done my lessons for the day.\"\\n\\n\"Do you study in vacation time?\" asked Jo.\\n\\n\"I follow the good example my neighbors set me,\" was Laurie\\'s answer,\\nas he swung himself out of the room.\\n\\n\"I have great hopes for my boy,\" observed Jo, watching him fly over the\\nfence with an approving smile.\\n\\n\"He does very well, for a boy,\" was Meg\\'s somewhat ungracious answer,\\nfor the subject did not interest her.\\n\\nDr. Bangs came, said Beth had symptoms of the fever, but he thought she\\nwould have it lightly, though he looked sober over the Hummel story.\\nAmy was ordered off at once, and provided with something to ward off\\ndanger, she departed in great state, with Jo and Laurie as escort.\\n\\nAunt March received them with her usual hospitality.\\n\\n\"What do you want now?\" she asked, looking sharply over her spectacles,\\nwhile the parrot, sitting on the back of her chair, called out...\\n\\n\"Go away.  No boys allowed here.\"\\n\\nLaurie retired to the window, and Jo told her story.\\n\\n\"No more than I expected, if you are allowed to go poking about among\\npoor folks.  Amy can stay and make herself useful if she isn\\'t sick,\\nwhich I\\'ve no doubt she will be, looks like it now.  Don\\'t cry, child,\\nit worries me to hear people sniff.\"\\n\\nAmy was on the point of crying, but Laurie slyly pulled the parrot\\'s\\ntail, which caused Polly to utter an astonished croak and call out,\\n\"Bless my boots!\" in such a funny way, that she laughed instead.\\n\\n\"What do you hear from your mother?\" asked the old lady gruffly.\\n\\n\"Father is much better,\" replied Jo, trying to keep sober.\\n\\n\"Oh, is he?  Well, that won\\'t last long, I fancy.  March never had any\\nstamina,\" was the cheerful reply.\\n\\n\"Ha, ha!  Never say die, take a pinch of snuff, goodbye, goodbye!\"\\nsqualled Polly, dancing on her perch, and clawing at the old lady\\'s cap\\nas Laurie tweaked him in the rear.\\n\\n\"Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird!  And, Jo, you\\'d better\\ngo at once.  It isn\\'t proper to be gadding about so late with a\\nrattlepated boy like...\"\\n\\n\"Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird!\" cried Polly, tumbling\\noff the chair with a bounce, and running to peck the \\'rattlepated\\' boy,\\nwho was shaking with laughter at the last speech.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think I can bear it, but I\\'ll try,\" thought Amy, as she was\\nleft alone with Aunt March.\\n\\n\"Get along, you fright!\" screamed Polly, and at that rude speech Amy\\ncould not restrain a sniff.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'EIGHTEEN\\n\\nDARK DAYS\\n\\nBeth did have the fever, and was much sicker than anyone but Hannah and\\nthe doctor suspected.  The girls knew nothing about illness, and Mr.\\nLaurence was not allowed to see her, so Hannah had everything her own\\nway, and busy Dr. Bangs did his best, but left a good deal to the\\nexcellent nurse.  Meg stayed at home, lest she should infect the Kings,\\nand kept house, feeling very anxious and a little guilty when she wrote\\nletters in which no mention was made of Beth\\'s illness.  She could not\\nthink it right to deceive her mother, but she had been bidden to mind\\nHannah, and Hannah wouldn\\'t hear of \\'Mrs. March bein\\' told, and worried\\njust for sech a trifle.\\'\\n\\nJo devoted herself to Beth day and night, not a hard task, for Beth was\\nvery patient, and bore her pain uncomplainingly as long as she could\\ncontrol herself.  But there came a time when during the fever fits she\\nbegan to talk in a hoarse, broken voice, to play on the coverlet as if\\non her beloved little piano, and try to sing with a throat so swollen\\nthat there was no music left, a time when she did not know the familiar\\nfaces around her, but addressed them by wrong names, and called\\nimploringly for her mother.  Then Jo grew frightened, Meg begged to be\\nallowed to write the truth, and even Hannah said she \\'would think of\\nit, though there was no danger yet\\'.  A letter from Washington added to\\ntheir trouble, for Mr. March had had a relapse, and could not think of\\ncoming home for a long while.\\n\\nHow dark the days seemed now, how sad and lonely the house, and how\\nheavy were the hearts of the sisters as they worked and waited, while\\nthe shadow of death hovered over the once happy home. Then it was that\\nMargaret, sitting alone with tears dropping often on her work, felt how\\nrich she had been in things more precious than any luxuries money could\\nbuy--in love, protection, peace, and health, the real blessings of\\nlife.  Then it was that Jo, living in the darkened room, with that\\nsuffering little sister always before her eyes and that pathetic voice\\nsounding in her ears, learned to see the beauty and the sweetness of\\nBeth\\'s nature, to feel how deep and tender a place she filled in all\\nhearts, and to acknowledge the worth of Beth\\'s unselfish ambition to\\nlive for others, and make home happy by that exercise of those simple\\nvirtues which all may possess, and which all should love and value more\\nthan talent, wealth, or beauty.  And Amy, in her exile, longed eagerly\\nto be at home, that she might work for Beth, feeling now that no\\nservice would be hard or irksome, and remembering, with regretful\\ngrief, how many neglected tasks those willing hands had done for her.\\nLaurie haunted the house like a restless ghost, and Mr. Laurence locked\\nthe grand piano, because he could not bear to be reminded of the young\\nneighbor who used to make the twilight pleasant for him.  Everyone\\nmissed Beth.  The milkman, baker, grocer, and butcher inquired how she\\ndid, poor Mrs. Hummel came to beg pardon for her thoughtlessness and to\\nget a shroud for Minna, the neighbors sent all sorts of comforts and\\ngood wishes, and even those who knew her best were surprised to find\\nhow many friends shy little Beth had made.\\n\\nMeanwhile she lay on her bed with old Joanna at her side, for even in\\nher wanderings she did not forget her forlorn protege.  She longed for\\nher cats, but would not have them brought, lest they should get sick,\\nand in her quiet hours she was full of anxiety about Jo.  She sent\\nloving messages to Amy, bade them tell her mother that she would write\\nsoon, and often begged for pencil and paper to try to say a word, that\\nFather might not think she had neglected him. But soon even these\\nintervals of consciousness ended, and she lay hour after hour, tossing\\nto and fro, with incoherent words on her lips, or sank into a heavy\\nsleep which brought her no refreshment. Dr. Bangs came twice a day,\\nHannah sat up at night, Meg kept a telegram in her desk all ready to\\nsend off at any minute, and Jo never stirred from Beth\\'s side.\\n\\nThe first of December was a wintry day indeed to them, for a bitter\\nwind blew, snow fell fast, and the year seemed getting ready for its\\ndeath.  When Dr. Bangs came that morning, he looked long at Beth, held\\nthe hot hand in both his own for a minute, and laid it gently down,\\nsaying, in a low voice to Hannah, \"If Mrs. March can leave her husband\\nshe\\'d better be sent for.\"\\n\\nHannah nodded without speaking, for her lips twitched nervously, Meg\\ndropped down into a chair as the strength seemed to go out of her limbs\\nat the sound of those words, and Jo, standing with a pale face for a\\nminute, ran to the parlor, snatched up the telegram, and throwing on\\nher things, rushed out into the storm.  She was soon back, and while\\nnoiselessly taking off her cloak, Laurie came in with a letter, saying\\nthat Mr. March was mending again.  Jo read it thankfully, but the heavy\\nweight did not seem lifted off her heart, and her face was so full of\\nmisery that Laurie asked quickly, \"What is it?  Is Beth worse?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve sent for Mother,\" said Jo, tugging at her rubber boots with a\\ntragic expression.\\n\\n\"Good for you, Jo!  Did you do it on your own responsibility?\" asked\\nLaurie, as he seated her in the hall chair and took off the rebellious\\nboots, seeing how her hands shook.\\n\\n\"No.  The doctor told us to.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Jo, it\\'s not so bad as that?\" cried Laurie, with a startled face.\\n\\n\"Yes, it is.  She doesn\\'t know us, she doesn\\'t even talk about the\\nflocks of green doves, as she calls the vine leaves on the wall. She\\ndoesn\\'t look like my Beth, and there\\'s nobody to help us bear it.\\nMother and father both gone, and God seems so far away I can\\'t find\\nHim.\"\\n\\nAs the tears streamed fast down poor Jo\\'s cheeks, she stretched out her\\nhand in a helpless sort of way, as if groping in the dark, and Laurie\\ntook it in his, whispering as well as he could with a lump in his\\nthroat, \"I\\'m here.  Hold on to me, Jo, dear!\"\\n\\nShe could not speak, but she did \\'hold on\\', and the warm grasp of the\\nfriendly human hand comforted her sore heart, and seemed to lead her\\nnearer to the Divine arm which alone could uphold her in her trouble.\\n\\nLaurie longed to say something tender and comfortable, but no fitting\\nwords came to him, so he stood silent, gently stroking her bent head as\\nher mother used to do.  It was the best thing he could have done, far\\nmore soothing than the most eloquent words, for Jo felt the unspoken\\nsympathy, and in the silence learned the sweet solace which affection\\nadministers to sorrow.  Soon she dried the tears which had relieved\\nher, and looked up with a grateful face.\\n\\n\"Thank you, Teddy, I\\'m better now.  I don\\'t feel so forlorn, and will\\ntry to bear it if it comes.\"\\n\\n\"Keep hoping for the best, that will help you, Jo.  Soon your mother\\nwill be here, and then everything will be all right.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m so glad Father is better.  Now she won\\'t feel so bad about leaving\\nhim.  Oh, me!  It does seem as if all the troubles came in a heap, and\\nI got the heaviest part on my shoulders,\" sighed Jo, spreading her wet\\nhandkerchief over her knees to dry.\\n\\n\"Doesn\\'t Meg pull fair?\" asked Laurie, looking indignant.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, she tries to, but she can\\'t love Bethy as I do, and she won\\'t\\nmiss her as I shall.  Beth is my conscience, and I can\\'t give her up.\\nI can\\'t!  I can\\'t!\"\\n\\nDown went Jo\\'s face into the wet handkerchief, and she cried\\ndespairingly, for she had kept up bravely till now and never shed a\\ntear.  Laurie drew his hand across his eyes, but could not speak till\\nhe had subdued the choky feeling in his throat and steadied his lips.\\nIt might be unmanly, but he couldn\\'t help it, and I am glad of it.\\nPresently, as Jo\\'s sobs quieted, he said hopefully, \"I don\\'t think she\\nwill die.  She\\'s so good, and we all love her so much, I don\\'t believe\\nGod will take her away yet.\"\\n\\n\"The good and dear people always do die,\" groaned Jo, but she stopped\\ncrying, for her friend\\'s words cheered her up in spite of her own\\ndoubts and fears.\\n\\n\"Poor girl, you\\'re worn out.  It isn\\'t like you to be forlorn. Stop a\\nbit.  I\\'ll hearten you up in a jiffy.\"\\n\\nLaurie went off two stairs at a time, and Jo laid her wearied head down\\non Beth\\'s little brown hood, which no one had thought of moving from\\nthe table where she left it.  It must have possessed some magic, for\\nthe submissive spirit of its gentle owner seemed to enter into Jo, and\\nwhen Laurie came running down with a glass of wine, she took it with a\\nsmile, and said bravely, \"I drink-- Health to my Beth!  You are a good\\ndoctor, Teddy, and such a comfortable friend.  How can I ever pay you?\"\\nshe added, as the wine refreshed her body, as the kind words had done\\nher troubled mind.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll send my bill, by-and-by, and tonight I\\'ll give you something that\\nwill warm the cockles of your heart better than quarts of wine,\" said\\nLaurie, beaming at her with a face of suppressed satisfaction at\\nsomething.\\n\\n\"What is it?\" cried Jo, forgetting her woes for a minute in her wonder.\\n\\n\"I telegraphed to your mother yesterday, and Brooke answered she\\'d come\\nat once, and she\\'ll be here tonight, and everything will be all right.\\nAren\\'t you glad I did it?\"\\n\\nLaurie spoke very fast, and turned red and excited all in a minute, for\\nhe had kept his plot a secret, for fear of disappointing the girls or\\nharming Beth.  Jo grew quite white, flew out of her chair, and the\\nmoment he stopped speaking she electrified him by throwing her arms\\nround his neck, and crying out, with a joyful cry, \"Oh, Laurie!  Oh,\\nMother!  I am so glad!\"  She did not weep again, but laughed\\nhysterically, and trembled and clung to her friend as if she was a\\nlittle bewildered by the sudden news.\\n\\nLaurie, though decidedly amazed, behaved with great presence of mind.\\nHe patted her back soothingly, and finding that she was recovering,\\nfollowed it up by a bashful kiss or two, which brought Jo round at\\nonce.  Holding on to the banisters, she put him gently away, saying\\nbreathlessly, \"Oh, don\\'t!  I didn\\'t mean to, it was dreadful of me, but\\nyou were such a dear to go and do it in spite of Hannah that I couldn\\'t\\nhelp flying at you.  Tell me all about it, and don\\'t give me wine\\nagain, it makes me act so.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t mind,\" laughed Laurie, as he settled his tie.  \"Why, you see I\\ngot fidgety, and so did Grandpa.  We thought Hannah was overdoing the\\nauthority business, and your mother ought to know. She\\'d never forgive\\nus if Beth...  Well, if anything happened, you know.  So I got grandpa\\nto say it was high time we did something, and off I pelted to the\\noffice yesterday, for the doctor looked sober, and Hannah most took my\\nhead off when I proposed a telegram.  I never can bear to be \\'lorded\\nover\\', so that settled my mind, and I did it. Your mother will come, I\\nknow, and the late train is in at two A.M. I shall go for her, and\\nyou\\'ve only got to bottle up your rapture, and keep Beth quiet till\\nthat blessed lady gets here.\"\\n\\n\"Laurie, you\\'re an angel!  How shall I ever thank you?\"\\n\\n\"Fly at me again.  I rather liked it,\" said Laurie, looking\\nmischievous, a thing he had not done for a fortnight.\\n\\n\"No, thank you.  I\\'ll do it by proxy, when your grandpa comes. Don\\'t\\ntease, but go home and rest, for you\\'ll be up half the night. Bless\\nyou, Teddy, bless you!\"\\n\\nJo had backed into a corner, and as she finished her speech, she\\nvanished precipitately into the kitchen, where she sat down upon a\\ndresser and told the assembled cats that she was \"happy, oh, so happy!\"\\nwhile Laurie departed, feeling that he had made a rather neat thing of\\nit.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the interferingest chap I ever see, but I forgive him and do\\nhope Mrs. March is coming right away,\" said Hannah, with an air of\\nrelief, when Jo told the good news.\\n\\nMeg had a quiet rapture, and then brooded over the letter, while Jo set\\nthe sickroom in order, and Hannah \"knocked up a couple of pies in case\\nof company unexpected\".  A breath of fresh air seemed to blow through\\nthe house, and something better than sunshine brightened the quiet\\nrooms.  Everything appeared to feel the hopeful change.  Beth\\'s bird\\nbegan to chirp again, and a half-blown rose was discovered on Amy\\'s\\nbush in the window. The fires seemed to burn with unusual cheeriness,\\nand every time the girls met, their pale faces broke into smiles as\\nthey hugged one another, whispering encouragingly, \"Mother\\'s coming,\\ndear! Mother\\'s coming!\"  Every one rejoiced but Beth.  She lay in that\\nheavy stupor, alike unconscious of hope and joy, doubt and danger. It\\nwas a piteous sight, the once rosy face so changed and vacant, the once\\nbusy hands so weak and wasted, the once smiling lips quite dumb, and\\nthe once pretty, well-kept hair scattered rough and tangled on the\\npillow.  All day she lay so, only rousing now and then to mutter,\\n\"Water!\" with lips so parched they could hardly shape the word.  All\\nday Jo and Meg hovered over her, watching, waiting, hoping, and\\ntrusting in God and Mother, and all day the snow fell, the bitter wind\\nraged, and the hours dragged slowly by.  But night came at last, and\\nevery time the clock struck, the sisters, still sitting on either side\\nof the bed, looked at each other with brightening eyes, for each hour\\nbrought help nearer.  The doctor had been in to say that some change,\\nfor better or worse, would probably take place about midnight, at which\\ntime he would return.\\n\\nHannah, quite worn out, lay down on the sofa at the bed\\'s foot and fell\\nfast asleep, Mr. Laurence marched to and fro in the parlor, feeling\\nthat he would rather face a rebel battery than Mrs. March\\'s countenance\\nas she entered.  Laurie lay on the rug, pretending to rest, but staring\\ninto the fire with the thoughtful look which made his black eyes\\nbeautifully soft and clear.\\n\\nThe girls never forgot that night, for no sleep came to them as they\\nkept their watch, with that dreadful sense of powerlessness which comes\\nto us in hours like those.\\n\\n\"If God spares Beth, I never will complain again,\" whispered Meg\\nearnestly.\\n\\n\"If god spares Beth, I\\'ll try to love and serve Him all my life,\"\\nanswered Jo, with equal fervor.\\n\\n\"I wish I had no heart, it aches so,\" sighed Meg, after a pause.\\n\\n\"If life is often as hard as this, I don\\'t see how we ever shall get\\nthrough it,\" added her sister despondently.\\n\\nHere the clock struck twelve, and both forgot themselves in watching\\nBeth, for they fancied a change passed over her wan face. The house was\\nstill as death, and nothing but the wailing of the wind broke the deep\\nhush.  Weary Hannah slept on, and no one but the sisters saw the pale\\nshadow which seemed to fall upon the little bed.  An hour went by, and\\nnothing happened except Laurie\\'s quiet departure for the station.\\nAnother hour, still no one came, and anxious fears of delay in the\\nstorm, or accidents by the way, or, worst of all, a great grief at\\nWashington, haunted the girls.\\n\\nIt was past two, when Jo, who stood at the window thinking how dreary\\nthe world looked in its winding sheet of snow, heard a movement by the\\nbed, and turning quickly, saw Meg kneeling before their mother\\'s easy\\nchair with her face hidden.  A dreadful fear passed coldly over Jo, as\\nshe thought, \"Beth is dead, and Meg is afraid to tell me.\"\\n\\nShe was back at her post in an instant, and to her excited eyes a great\\nchange seemed to have taken place.  The fever flush and the look of\\npain were gone, and the beloved little face looked so pale and peaceful\\nin its utter repose that Jo felt no desire to weep or to lament.\\nLeaning low over this dearest of her sisters, she kissed the damp\\nforehead with her heart on her lips, and softly whispered, \"Good-by, my\\nBeth.  Good-by!\"\\n\\nAs if awaked by the stir, Hannah started out of her sleep, hurried to\\nthe bed, looked at Beth, felt her hands, listened at her lips, and\\nthen, throwing her apron over her head, sat down to rock to and fro,\\nexclaiming, under her breath, \"The fever\\'s turned, she\\'s sleepin\\'\\nnat\\'ral, her skin\\'s damp, and she breathes easy.  Praise be given!  Oh,\\nmy goodness me!\"\\n\\nBefore the girls could believe the happy truth, the doctor came to\\nconfirm it.  He was a homely man, but they thought his face quite\\nheavenly when he smiled and said, with a fatherly look at them, \"Yes,\\nmy dears, I think the little girl will pull through this time.  Keep\\nthe house quiet, let her sleep, and when she wakes, give her...\"\\n\\nWhat they were to give, neither heard, for both crept into the dark\\nhall, and, sitting on the stairs, held each other close, rejoicing with\\nhearts too full for words.  When they went back to be kissed and\\ncuddled by faithful Hannah, they found Beth lying, as she used to do,\\nwith her cheek pillowed on her hand, the dreadful pallor gone, and\\nbreathing quietly, as if just fallen asleep.\\n\\n\"If Mother would only come now!\" said Jo, as the winter night began to\\nwane.\\n\\n\"See,\" said Meg, coming up with a white, half-opened rose, \"I thought\\nthis would hardly be ready to lay in Beth\\'s hand tomorrow if she--went\\naway from us.  But it has blossomed in the night, and now I mean to put\\nit in my vase here, so that when the darling wakes, the first thing she\\nsees will be the little rose, and Mother\\'s face.\"\\n\\nNever had the sun risen so beautifully, and never had the world seemed\\nso lovely as it did to the heavy eyes of Meg and Jo, as they looked out\\nin the early morning, when their long, sad vigil was done.\\n\\n\"It looks like a fairy world,\" said Meg, smiling to herself, as she\\nstood behind the curtain, watching the dazzling sight.\\n\\n\"Hark!\" cried Jo, starting to her feet.\\n\\nYes, there was a sound of bells at the door below, a cry from Hannah,\\nand then Laurie\\'s voice saying in a joyful whisper, \"Girls, she\\'s come!\\nShe\\'s come!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'NINETEEN\\n\\nAMY\\'S WILL\\n\\nWhile these things were happening at home, Amy was having hard times at\\nAunt March\\'s.  She felt her exile deeply, and for the first time in her\\nlife, realized how much she was beloved and petted at home.  Aunt March\\nnever petted any one; she did not approve of it, but she meant to be\\nkind, for the well-behaved little girl pleased her very much, and Aunt\\nMarch had a soft place in her old heart for her nephew\\'s children,\\nthough she didn\\'t think it proper to confess it.  She really did her\\nbest to make Amy happy, but, dear me, what mistakes she made. Some old\\npeople keep young at heart in spite of wrinkles and gray hairs, can\\nsympathize with children\\'s little cares and joys, make them feel at\\nhome, and can hide wise lessons under pleasant plays, giving and\\nreceiving friendship in the sweetest way.  But Aunt March had not this\\ngift, and she worried Amy very much with her rules and orders, her prim\\nways, and long, prosy talks.  Finding the child more docile and amiable\\nthan her sister, the old lady felt it her duty to try and counteract,\\nas far as possible, the bad effects of home freedom and indulgence.  So\\nshe took Amy by the hand, and taught her as she herself had been taught\\nsixty years ago, a process which carried dismay to Amy\\'s soul, and made\\nher feel like a fly in the web of a very strict spider.\\n\\nShe had to wash the cups every morning, and polish up the old-fashioned\\nspoons, the fat silver teapot, and the glasses till they shone.  Then\\nshe must dust the room, and what a trying job that was.  Not a speck\\nescaped Aunt March\\'s eye, and all the furniture had claw legs and much\\ncarving, which was never dusted to suit.  Then Polly had to be fed, the\\nlap dog combed, and a dozen trips upstairs and down to get things or\\ndeliver orders, for the old lady was very lame and seldom left her big\\nchair.  After these tiresome labors, she must do her lessons, which was\\na daily trial of every virtue she possessed.  Then she was allowed one\\nhour for exercise or play, and didn\\'t she enjoy it?\\n\\nLaurie came every day, and wheedled Aunt March till Amy was allowed to\\ngo out with him, when they walked and rode and had capital times.\\nAfter dinner, she had to read aloud, and sit still while the old lady\\nslept, which she usually did for an hour, as she dropped off over the\\nfirst page.  Then patchwork or towels appeared, and Amy sewed with\\noutward meekness and inward rebellion till dusk, when she was allowed\\nto amuse herself as she liked till teatime.  The evenings were the\\nworst of all, for Aunt March fell to telling long stories about her\\nyouth, which were so unutterably dull that Amy was always ready to go\\nto bed, intending to cry over her hard fate, but usually going to sleep\\nbefore she had squeezed out more than a tear or two.\\n\\nIf it had not been for Laurie, and old Esther, the maid, she felt that\\nshe never could have got through that dreadful time.  The parrot alone\\nwas enough to drive her distracted, for he soon felt that she did not\\nadmire him, and revenged himself by being as mischievous as possible.\\nHe pulled her hair whenever she came near him, upset his bread and milk\\nto plague her when she had newly cleaned his cage, made Mop bark by\\npecking at him while Madam dozed, called her names before company, and\\nbehaved in all respects like an reprehensible old bird.  Then she could\\nnot endure the dog, a fat, cross beast who snarled and yelped at her\\nwhen she made his toilet, and who lay on his back with all his legs in\\nthe air and a most idiotic expression of countenance when he wanted\\nsomething to eat, which was about a dozen times a day.  The cook was\\nbad-tempered, the old coachman was deaf, and Esther the only one who\\never took any notice of the young lady.\\n\\nEsther was a Frenchwoman, who had lived with \\'Madame\\', as she called her\\nmistress, for many years, and who rather tyrannized over the old lady,\\nwho could not get along without her. Her real name was Estelle, but\\nAunt March ordered her to change it, and she obeyed, on condition that\\nshe was never asked to change her religion.  She took a fancy to\\nMademoiselle, and amused her very much with odd stories of her life in\\nFrance, when Amy sat with her while she got up Madame\\'s laces.  She\\nalso allowed her to roam about the great house, and examine the curious\\nand pretty things stored away in the big wardrobes and the ancient\\nchests, for Aunt March hoarded like a magpie.  Amy\\'s chief delight was\\nan Indian cabinet, full of queer drawers, little pigeonholes, and\\nsecret places, in which were kept all sorts of ornaments, some\\nprecious, some merely curious, all more or less antique. To examine and\\narrange these things gave Amy great satisfaction, especially the jewel\\ncases, in which on velvet cushions reposed the ornaments which had\\nadorned a belle forty years ago.  There was the garnet set which Aunt\\nMarch wore when she came out, the pearls her father gave her on her\\nwedding day, her lover\\'s diamonds, the jet mourning rings and pins, the\\nqueer lockets, with portraits of dead friends and weeping willows made\\nof hair inside, the baby bracelets her one little daughter had worn,\\nUncle March\\'s big watch, with the red seal so many childish hands had\\nplayed with, and in a box all by itself lay Aunt March\\'s wedding ring,\\ntoo small now for her fat finger, but put carefully away like the most\\nprecious jewel of them all.\\n\\n\"Which would Mademoiselle choose if she had her will?\" asked Esther,\\nwho always sat near to watch over and lock up the valuables.\\n\\n\"I like the diamonds best, but there is no necklace among them, and I\\'m\\nfond of necklaces, they are so becoming.  I should choose this if I\\nmight,\" replied Amy, looking with great admiration at a string of gold\\nand ebony beads from which hung a heavy cross of the same.\\n\\n\"I, too, covet that, but not as a necklace.  Ah, no!  To me it is a\\nrosary, and as such I should use it like a good catholic,\" said Esther,\\neyeing the handsome thing wistfully.\\n\\n\"Is it meant to use as you use the string of good-smelling wooden beads\\nhanging over your glass?\" asked Amy.\\n\\n\"Truly, yes, to pray with.  It would be pleasing to the saints if one\\nused so fine a rosary as this, instead of wearing it as a vain bijou.\"\\n\\n\"You seem to take a great deal of comfort in your prayers, Esther, and\\nalways come down looking quiet and satisfied.  I wish I could.\"\\n\\n\"If Mademoiselle was a Catholic, she would find true comfort, but as\\nthat is not to be, it would be well if you went apart each day to\\nmeditate and pray, as did the good mistress whom I served before\\nMadame.  She had a little chapel, and in it found solacement for much\\ntrouble.\"\\n\\n\"Would it be right for me to do so too?\" asked Amy, who in her\\nloneliness felt the need of help of some sort, and found that she was\\napt to forget her little book, now that Beth was not there to remind\\nher of it.\\n\\n\"It would be excellent and charming, and I shall gladly arrange the\\nlittle dressing room for you if you like it.  Say nothing to Madame,\\nbut when she sleeps go you and sit alone a while to think good\\nthoughts, and pray the dear God preserve your sister.\"\\n\\nEsther was truly pious, and quite sincere in her advice, for she had an\\naffectionate heart, and felt much for the sisters in their anxiety.\\nAmy liked the idea, and gave her leave to arrange the light closet next\\nher room, hoping it would do her good.\\n\\n\"I wish I knew where all these pretty things would go when Aunt March\\ndies,\" she said, as she slowly replaced the shining rosary and shut the\\njewel cases one by one.\\n\\n\"To you and your sisters.  I know it, Madame confides in me. I\\nwitnessed her will, and it is to be so,\" whispered Esther smiling.\\n\\n\\n\"How nice!  But I wish she\\'d let us have them now. Procrastination is\\nnot agreeable,\" observed Amy, taking a last look at the diamonds.\\n\\n\"It is too soon yet for the young ladies to wear these things. The\\nfirst one who is affianced will have the pearls, Madame has said it,\\nand I have a fancy that the little turquoise ring will be given to you\\nwhen you go, for Madame approves your good behavior and charming\\nmanners.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think so?  Oh, I\\'ll be a lamb, if I can only have that lovely\\nring!  It\\'s ever so much prettier than Kitty Bryant\\'s.  I do like Aunt\\nMarch after all.\" And Amy tried on the blue ring with a delighted face\\nand a firm resolve to earn it.\\n\\nFrom that day she was a model of obedience, and the old lady\\ncomplacently admired the success of her training.  Esther fitted up the\\ncloset with a little table, placed a footstool before it, and over it a\\npicture taken from one of the shut-up rooms.  She thought it was of no\\ngreat value, but, being appropriate, she borrowed it, well knowing that\\nMadame would never know it, nor care if she did.  It was, however, a\\nvery valuable copy of one of the famous pictures of the world, and\\nAmy\\'s beauty-loving eyes were never tired of looking up at the sweet\\nface of the Divine Mother, while her tender thoughts of her own were\\nbusy at her heart.  On the table she laid her little testament and\\nhymnbook, kept a vase always full of the best flowers Laurie brought\\nher, and came every day to \\'sit alone\\' thinking good thoughts, and\\npraying the dear God to preserve her sister.  Esther had given her a\\nrosary of black beads with a silver cross, but Amy hung it up and did\\nnot use it, feeling doubtful as to its fitness for Protestant prayers.\\n\\nThe little girl was very sincere in all this, for being left alone\\noutside the safe home nest, she felt the need of some kind hand to hold\\nby so sorely that she instinctively turned to the strong and tender\\nFriend, whose fatherly love most closely surrounds His little children.\\nShe missed her mother\\'s help to understand and rule herself, but having\\nbeen taught where to look, she did her best to find the way and walk in\\nit confidingly.  But, Amy was a young pilgrim, and just now her burden\\nseemed very heavy. She tried to forget herself, to keep cheerful, and\\nbe satisfied with doing right, though no one saw or praised her for it.\\nIn her first effort at being very, very good, she decided to make her\\nwill, as Aunt March had done, so that if she did fall ill and die, her\\npossessions might be justly and generously divided.  It cost her a pang\\neven to think of giving up the little treasures which in her eyes were\\nas precious as the old lady\\'s jewels.\\n\\nDuring one of her play hours she wrote out the important document as\\nwell as she could, with some help from Esther as to certain legal\\nterms, and when the good-natured Frenchwoman had signed her name, Amy\\nfelt relieved and laid it by to show Laurie, whom she wanted as a\\nsecond witness.  As it was a rainy day, she went upstairs to amuse\\nherself in one of the large chambers, and took Polly with her for\\ncompany.  In this room there was a wardrobe full of old-fashioned\\ncostumes with which Esther allowed her to play, and it was her favorite\\namusement to array herself in the faded brocades, and parade up and\\ndown before the long mirror, making stately curtsies, and sweeping her\\ntrain about with a rustle which delighted her ears.  So busy was she on\\nthis day that she did not hear Laurie\\'s ring nor see his face peeping\\nin at her as she gravely promenaded to and fro, flirting her fan and\\ntossing her head, on which she wore a great pink turban, contrasting\\noddly with her blue brocade dress and yellow quilted petticoat.  She\\nwas obliged to walk carefully, for she had on high-heeled shoes, and, as\\nLaurie told Jo afterward, it was a comical sight to see her mince along\\nin her gay suit, with Polly sidling and bridling just behind her,\\nimitating her as well as he could, and occasionally stopping to laugh\\nor exclaim, \"Ain\\'t we fine? Get along, you fright!  Hold your tongue!\\nKiss me, dear!  Ha! Ha!\"\\n\\nHaving with difficulty restrained an explosion of merriment, lest it\\nshould offend her majesty, Laurie tapped and was graciously received.\\n\\n\"Sit down and rest while I put these things away, then I want to\\nconsult you about a very serious matter,\" said Amy, when she had shown\\nher splendor and driven Polly into a corner.  \"That bird is the trial\\nof my life,\" she continued, removing the pink mountain from her head,\\nwhile Laurie seated himself astride a chair.\\n\\n\"Yesterday, when Aunt was asleep and I was trying to be as still as a\\nmouse, Polly began to squall and flap about in his cage, so I went to\\nlet him out, and found a big spider there.  I poked it out, and it ran\\nunder the bookcase.  Polly marched straight after it, stooped down and\\npeeped under the bookcase, saying, in his funny way, with a cock of his\\neye, \\'Come out and take a walk, my dear.\\' I couldn\\'t help laughing,\\nwhich made Poll swear, and Aunt woke up and scolded us both.\"\\n\\n\"Did the spider accept the old fellow\\'s invitation?\" asked Laurie,\\nyawning.\\n\\n\"Yes, out it came, and away ran Polly, frightened to death, and\\nscrambled up on Aunt\\'s chair, calling out, \\'Catch her! Catch her! Catch\\nher!\\' as I chased the spider.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s a lie!  Oh, lor!\" cried the parrot, pecking at Laurie\\'s toes.\\n\\n\"I\\'d wring your neck if you were mine, you old torment,\" cried Laurie,\\nshaking his fist at the bird, who put his head on one side and gravely\\ncroaked, \"Allyluyer! bless your buttons, dear!\"\\n\\n\"Now I\\'m ready,\" said Amy, shutting the wardrobe and taking a piece of\\npaper out of her pocket.  \"I want you to read that, please, and tell me\\nif it is legal and right.  I felt I ought to do it, for life is\\nuncertain and I don\\'t want any ill feeling over my tomb.\"\\n\\nLaurie bit his lips, and turning a little from the pensive speaker,\\nread the following document, with praiseworthy gravity, considering the\\nspelling:\\n\\nMY LAST WILL AND TESTIMENT\\n\\nI, Amy Curtis March, being in my sane mind, go give and bequeethe all\\nmy earthly property--viz. to wit:--namely\\n\\nTo my father, my best pictures, sketches, maps, and works of art,\\nincluding frames.  Also my $100, to do what he likes with.\\n\\nTo my mother, all my clothes, except the blue apron with pockets--also\\nmy likeness, and my medal, with much love.\\n\\nTo my dear sister Margaret, I give my turkquoise ring (if I get it),\\nalso my green box with the doves on it, also my piece of real lace for\\nher neck, and my sketch of her as a memorial of her \\'little girl\\'.\\n\\nTo Jo I leave my breastpin, the one mended with sealing wax, also my\\nbronze inkstand--she lost the cover--and my most precious plaster\\nrabbit, because I am sorry I burned up her story.\\n\\nTo Beth (if she lives after me) I give my dolls and the little bureau,\\nmy fan, my linen collars and my new slippers if she can wear them being\\nthin when she gets well.  And I herewith also leave her my regret that\\nI ever made fun of old Joanna.\\n\\nTo my friend and neighbor Theodore Laurence I bequeethe my paper mashay\\nportfolio, my clay model of a horse though he did say it hadn\\'t any\\nneck.  Also in return for his great kindness in the hour of affliction\\nany one of my artistic works he likes, Noter Dame is the best.\\n\\nTo our venerable benefactor Mr. Laurence I leave my purple box with a\\nlooking glass in the cover which will be nice for his pens and remind\\nhim of the departed girl who thanks him for his favors to her family,\\nespecially Beth.\\n\\nI wish my favorite playmate Kitty Bryant to have the blue silk apron\\nand my gold-bead ring with a kiss.\\n\\nTo Hannah I give the bandbox she wanted and all the patchwork I leave\\nhoping she \\'will remember me, when it you see\\'.\\n\\nAnd now having disposed of my most valuable property I hope all will be\\nsatisfied and not blame the dead.  I forgive everyone, and trust we may\\nall meet when the trump shall sound.  Amen.\\n\\nTo this will and testiment I set my hand and seal on this 20th day of\\nNov.  Anni Domino 1861.\\n\\nAmy Curtis March\\n\\nWitnesses:\\n\\nEstelle Valnor, Theodore Laurence.\\n\\n\\nThe last name was written in pencil, and Amy explained that he was to\\nrewrite it in ink and seal it up for her properly.\\n\\n\"What put it into your head?  Did anyone tell you about Beth\\'s giving\\naway her things?\" asked Laurie soberly, as Amy laid a bit of red tape,\\nwith sealing wax, a taper, and a standish before him.\\n\\nShe explained and then asked anxiously, \"What about Beth?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry I spoke, but as I did, I\\'ll tell you.  She felt so ill one\\nday that she told Jo she wanted to give her piano to Meg, her cats to\\nyou, and the poor old doll to Jo, who would love it for her sake.  She\\nwas sorry she had so little to give, and left locks of hair to the rest\\nof us, and her best love to Grandpa.  She never thought of a will.\"\\n\\nLaurie was signing and sealing as he spoke, and did not look up till a\\ngreat tear dropped on the paper.  Amy\\'s face was full of trouble, but\\nshe only said, \"Don\\'t people put sort of postscripts to their wills,\\nsometimes?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, \\'codicils\\', they call them.\"\\n\\n\"Put one in mine then, that I wish all my curls cut off, and given\\nround to my friends.  I forgot it, but I want it done though it will\\nspoil my looks.\"\\n\\nLaurie added it, smiling at Amy\\'s last and greatest sacrifice. Then he\\namused her for an hour, and was much interested in all her trials.  But\\nwhen he came to go, Amy held him back to whisper with trembling lips,\\n\"Is there really any danger about Beth?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid there is, but we must hope for the best, so don\\'t cry,\\ndear.\"  And Laurie put his arm about her with a brotherly gesture which\\nwas very comforting.\\n\\nWhen he had gone, she went to her little chapel, and sitting in the\\ntwilight, prayed for Beth, with streaming tears and an aching heart,\\nfeeling that a million turquoise rings would not console her for the\\nloss of her gentle little sister.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'TWENTY\\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL\\n\\nI don\\'t think I have any words in which to tell the meeting of the\\nmother and daughters.  Such hours are beautiful to live, but very hard\\nto describe, so I will leave it to the imagination of my readers,\\nmerely saying that the house was full of genuine happiness, and that\\nMeg\\'s tender hope was realized, for when Beth woke from that long,\\nhealing sleep, the first objects on which her eyes fell were the little\\nrose and Mother\\'s face.  Too weak to wonder at anything, she only\\nsmiled and nestled close in the loving arms about her, feeling that the\\nhungry longing was satisfied at last.  Then she slept again, and the\\ngirls waited upon their mother, for she would not unclasp the thin hand\\nwhich clung to hers even in sleep.\\n\\nHannah had \\'dished up\\' an astonishing breakfast for the traveler,\\nfinding it impossible to vent her excitement in any other way, and Meg\\nand Jo fed their mother like dutiful young storks, while they listened\\nto her whispered account of Father\\'s state, Mr. Brooke\\'s promise to\\nstay and nurse him, the delays which the storm occasioned on the\\nhomeward journey, and the unspeakable comfort Laurie\\'s hopeful face had\\ngiven her when she arrived, worn out with fatigue, anxiety, and cold.\\n\\nWhat a strange yet pleasant day that was.  So brilliant and gay\\nwithout, for all the world seemed abroad to welcome the first snow.  So\\nquiet and reposeful within, for everyone slept, spent with watching,\\nand a Sabbath stillness reigned through the house, while nodding Hannah\\nmounted guard at the door.  With a blissful sense of burdens lifted\\noff, Meg and Jo closed their weary eyes, and lay at rest, like\\nstorm-beaten boats safe at anchor in a quiet harbor.  Mrs. March would\\nnot leave Beth\\'s side, but rested in the big chair, waking often to\\nlook at, touch, and brood over her child, like a miser over some\\nrecovered treasure.\\n\\nLaurie meanwhile posted off to comfort Amy, and told his story so well\\nthat Aunt March actually \\'sniffed\\' herself, and never once said \"I told\\nyou so\".  Amy came out so strong on this occasion that I think the good\\nthoughts in the little chapel really began to bear fruit.  She dried\\nher tears quickly, restrained her impatience to see her mother, and\\nnever even thought of the turquoise ring, when the old lady heartily\\nagreed in Laurie\\'s opinion, that she behaved \\'like a capital little\\nwoman\\'.  Even Polly seemed impressed, for he called her a good girl,\\nblessed her buttons, and begged her to \"come and take a walk, dear\", in\\nhis most affable tone.  She would very gladly have gone out to enjoy\\nthe bright wintry weather, but discovering that Laurie was dropping\\nwith sleep in spite of manful efforts to conceal the fact, she\\npersuaded him to rest on the sofa, while she wrote a note to her\\nmother.  She was a long time about it, and when she returned, he was\\nstretched out with both arms under his head, sound asleep, while Aunt\\nMarch had pulled down the curtains and sat doing nothing in an unusual\\nfit of benignity.\\n\\nAfter a while, they began to think he was not going to wake up till\\nnight, and I\\'m not sure that he would, had he not been effectually\\nroused by Amy\\'s cry of joy at sight of her mother. There probably were\\na good many happy little girls in and about the city that day, but it\\nis my private opinion that Amy was the happiest of all, when she sat in\\nher mother\\'s lap and told her trials, receiving consolation and\\ncompensation in the shape of approving smiles and fond caresses.  They\\nwere alone together in the chapel, to which her mother did not object\\nwhen its purpose was explained to her.\\n\\n\"On the contrary, I like it very much, dear,\" looking from the dusty\\nrosary to the well-worn little book, and the lovely picture with its\\ngarland of evergreen.  \"It is an excellent plan to have some place\\nwhere we can go to be quiet, when things vex or grieve us.  There are a\\ngood many hard times in this life of ours, but we can always bear them\\nif we ask help in the right way.  I think my little girl is learning\\nthis.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Mother, and when I go home I mean to have a corner in the big\\ncloset to put my books and the copy of that picture which I\\'ve tried to\\nmake.  The woman\\'s face is not good, it\\'s too beautiful for me to draw,\\nbut the baby is done better, and I love it very much.  I like to think\\nHe was a little child once, for then I don\\'t seem so far away, and that\\nhelps me.\"\\n\\nAs Amy pointed to the smiling Christ child on his Mother\\'s knee, Mrs.\\nMarch saw something on the lifted hand that made her smile.  She said\\nnothing, but Amy understood the look, and after a minute\\'s pause, she\\nadded gravely, \"I wanted to speak to you about this, but I forgot it.\\nAunt gave me the ring today.  She called me to her and kissed me, and\\nput it on my finger, and said I was a credit to her, and she\\'d like to\\nkeep me always. She gave that funny guard to keep the turquoise on, as\\nit\\'s too big.  I\\'d like to wear them Mother, can I?\"\\n\\n\"They are very pretty, but I think you\\'re rather too young for such\\nornaments, Amy,\" said Mrs. March, looking at the plump little hand,\\nwith the band of sky-blue stones on the forefinger, and the quaint\\nguard formed of two tiny golden hands clasped together.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll try not to be vain,\" said Amy.  \"I don\\'t think I like it only\\nbecause it\\'s so pretty, but I want to wear it as the girl in the story\\nwore her bracelet, to remind me of something.\"\\n\\n\"Do you mean Aunt March?\" asked her mother, laughing.\\n\\n\"No, to remind me not to be selfish.\"  Amy looked so earnest and\\nsincere about it that her mother stopped laughing, and listened\\nrespectfully to the little plan.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve thought a great deal lately about my \\'bundle of naughties\\', and\\nbeing selfish is the largest one in it, so I\\'m going to try hard to\\ncure it, if I can.  Beth isn\\'t selfish, and that\\'s the reason everyone\\nloves her and feels so bad at the thoughts of losing her.  People\\nwouldn\\'t feel so bad about me if I was sick, and I don\\'t deserve to\\nhave them, but I\\'d like to be loved and missed by a great many friends,\\nso I\\'m going to try and be like Beth all I can.  I\\'m apt to forget my\\nresolutions, but if I had something always about me to remind me, I\\nguess I should do better.  May we try this way?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but I have more faith in the corner of the big closet. Wear your\\nring, dear, and do your best.  I think you will prosper, for the\\nsincere wish to be good is half the battle.  Now I must go back to\\nBeth.  Keep up your heart, little daughter, and we will soon have you\\nhome again.\"\\n\\nThat evening while Meg was writing to her father to report the\\ntraveler\\'s safe arrival, Jo slipped upstairs into Beth\\'s room, and\\nfinding her mother in her usual place, stood a minute twisting her\\nfingers in her hair, with a worried gesture and an undecided look.\\n\\n\"What is it, deary?\" asked Mrs. March, holding out her hand, with a\\nface which invited confidence.\\n\\n\"I want to tell you something, Mother.\"\\n\\n\"About Meg?\"\\n\\n\"How quickly you guessed!  Yes, it\\'s about her, and though it\\'s a\\nlittle thing, it fidgets me.\"\\n\\n\"Beth is asleep.  Speak low, and tell me all about it.  That Moffat\\nhasn\\'t been here, I hope?\" asked Mrs. March rather sharply.\\n\\n\"No.  I should have shut the door in his face if he had,\" said Jo,\\nsettling herself on the floor at her mother\\'s feet.  \"Last summer Meg\\nleft a pair of gloves over at the Laurences\\' and only one was returned.\\nWe forgot about it, till Teddy told me that Mr. Brooke owned that he\\nliked Meg but didn\\'t dare say so, she was so young and he so poor.\\nNow, isn\\'t it a dreadful state of things?\"\\n\\n\"Do you think Meg cares for him?\" asked Mrs. March, with an anxious\\nlook.\\n\\n\"Mercy me!  I don\\'t know anything about love and such nonsense!\" cried\\nJo, with a funny mixture of interest and contempt. \"In novels, the\\ngirls show it by starting and blushing, fainting away, growing thin,\\nand acting like fools.  Now Meg does not do anything of the sort.  She\\neats and drinks and sleeps like a sensible creature, she looks straight\\nin my face when I talk about that man, and only blushes a little bit\\nwhen Teddy jokes about lovers.  I forbid him to do it, but he doesn\\'t\\nmind me as he ought.\"\\n\\n\"Then you fancy that Meg is not interested in John?\"\\n\\n\"Who?\" cried Jo, staring.\\n\\n\"Mr. Brooke.  I call him \\'John\\' now.  We fell into the way of doing so\\nat the hospital, and he likes it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, dear!  I know you\\'ll take his part.  He\\'s been good to Father, and\\nyou won\\'t send him away, but let Meg marry him, if she wants to.  Mean\\nthing!  To go petting Papa and helping you, just to wheedle you into\\nliking him.\" And Jo pulled her hair again with a wrathful tweak.\\n\\n\"My dear, don\\'t get angry about it, and I will tell you how it\\nhappened.  John went with me at Mr. Laurence\\'s request, and was so\\ndevoted to poor Father that we couldn\\'t help getting fond of him.  He\\nwas perfectly open and honorable about Meg, for he told us he loved\\nher, but would earn a comfortable home before he asked her to marry\\nhim.  He only wanted our leave to love her and work for her, and the\\nright to make her love him if he could. He is a truly excellent young\\nman, and we could not refuse to listen to him, but I will not consent\\nto Meg\\'s engaging herself so young.\"\\n\\n\"Of course not.  It would be idiotic!  I knew there was mischief\\nbrewing.  I felt it, and now it\\'s worse than I imagined. I just wish I\\ncould marry Meg myself, and keep her safe in the family.\"\\n\\nThis odd arrangement made Mrs. March smile, but she said gravely, \"Jo,\\nI confide in you and don\\'t wish you to say anything to Meg yet.  When\\nJohn comes back, and I see them together, I can judge better of her\\nfeelings toward him.\"\\n\\n\"She\\'ll see those handsome eyes that she talks about, and then it will\\nbe all up with her.  She\\'s got such a soft heart, it will melt like\\nbutter in the sun if anyone looks sentimentlly at her.  She read the\\nshort reports he sent more than she did your letters, and pinched me\\nwhen I spoke of it, and likes brown eyes, and doesn\\'t think John an\\nugly name, and she\\'ll go and fall in love, and there\\'s an end of peace\\nand fun, and cozy times together. I see it all!  They\\'ll go lovering\\naround the house, and we shall have to dodge.  Meg will be absorbed and\\nno good to me any more. Brooke will scratch up a fortune somehow, carry\\nher off, and make a hole in the family, and I shall break my heart, and\\neverything will be abominably uncomfortable.  Oh, dear me!  Why weren\\'t\\nwe all boys, then there wouldn\\'t be any bother.\"\\n\\nJo leaned her chin on her knees in a disconsolate attitude and shook\\nher fist at the reprehensible John.  Mrs. March sighed, and Jo looked\\nup with an air of relief.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t like it, Mother?  I\\'m glad of it.  Let\\'s send him about his\\nbusiness, and not tell Meg a word of it, but all be happy together as\\nwe always have been.\"\\n\\n\"I did wrong to sigh, Jo.  It is natural and right you should all go to\\nhomes of your own in time, but I do want to keep my girls as long as I\\ncan, and I am sorry that this happened so soon, for Meg is only\\nseventeen and it will be some years before John can make a home for\\nher.  Your father and I have agreed that she shall not bind herself in\\nany way, nor be married, before twenty.  If she and John love one\\nanother, they can wait, and test the love by doing so.  She is\\nconscientious, and I have no fear of her treating him unkindly.  My\\npretty, tender hearted girl!  I hope things will go happily with her.\"\\n\\n\"Hadn\\'t you rather have her marry a rich man?\" asked Jo, as her\\nmother\\'s voice faltered a little over the last words.\\n\\n\"Money is a good and useful thing, Jo, and I hope my girls will never\\nfeel the need of it too bitterly, nor be tempted by too much.  I should\\nlike to know that John was firmly established in some good business,\\nwhich gave him an income large enough to keep free from debt and make\\nMeg comfortable.  I\\'m not ambitious for a splendid fortune, a\\nfashionable position, or a great name for my girls.  If rank and money\\ncome with love and virtue, also, I should accept them gratefully, and\\nenjoy your good fortune, but I know, by experience, how much genuine\\nhappiness can be had in a plain little house, where the daily bread is\\nearned, and some privations give sweetness to the few pleasures.  I am\\ncontent to see Meg begin humbly, for if I am not mistaken, she will be\\nrich in the possession of a good man\\'s heart, and that is better than a\\nfortune.\"\\n\\n\"I understand, Mother, and quite agree, but I\\'m disappointed about Meg,\\nfor I\\'d planned to have her marry Teddy by-and-by and sit in the lap of\\nluxury all her days.  Wouldn\\'t it be nice?\" asked Jo, looking up with a\\nbrighter face.\\n\\n\"He is younger than she, you know,\" began Mrs. March, but Jo broke in...\\n\\n\"Only a little, he\\'s old for his age, and tall, and can be quite\\ngrown-up in his manners if he likes.  Then he\\'s rich and generous and\\ngood, and loves us all, and I say it\\'s a pity my plan is spoiled.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid Laurie is hardly grown-up enough for Meg, and altogether\\ntoo much of a weathercock just now for anyone to depend on.  Don\\'t make\\nplans, Jo, but let time and their own hearts mate your friends.  We\\ncan\\'t meddle safely in such matters, and had better not get \\'romantic\\nrubbish\\' as you call it, into our heads, lest it spoil our friendship.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I won\\'t, but I hate to see things going all crisscross and\\ngetting snarled up, when a pull here and a snip there would straighten\\nit out.  I wish wearing flatirons on our heads would keep us from\\ngrowing up.  But buds will be roses, and kittens cats, more\\'s the pity!\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s that about flatirons and cats?\" asked Meg, as she crept into\\nthe room with the finished letter in her hand.\\n\\n\"Only one of my stupid speeches.  I\\'m going to bed.  Come, Peggy,\" said\\nJo, unfolding herself like an animated puzzle.\\n\\n\"Quite right, and beautifully written.  Please add that I send my love\\nto John,\" said Mrs. March, as she glanced over the letter and gave it\\nback.\\n\\n\"Do you call him \\'John\\'?\" asked Meg, smiling, with her innocent eyes\\nlooking down into her mother\\'s.\\n\\n\"Yes, he has been like a son to us, and we are very fond of him,\"\\nreplied Mrs. March, returning the look with a keen one.\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad of that, he is so lonely.  Good night, Mother, dear.  It is\\nso inexpressibly comfortable to have you here,\" was Meg\\'s answer.\\n\\nThe kiss her mother gave her was a very tender one, and as she went\\naway, Mrs. March said, with a mixture of satisfaction and regret, \"She\\ndoes not love John yet, but will soon learn to.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'TWENTY-ONE\\n\\nLAURIE MAKES MISCHIEF, AND JO MAKES PEACE\\n\\nJo\\'s face was a study next day, for the secret rather weighed upon her,\\nand she found it hard not to look mysterious and important.  Meg\\nobserved it, but did not trouble herself to make inquiries, for she had\\nlearned that the best way to manage Jo was by the law of contraries, so\\nshe felt sure of being told everything if she did not ask.  She was\\nrather surprised, therefore, when the silence remained unbroken, and Jo\\nassumed a patronizing air, which decidedly aggravated Meg, who in turn\\nassumed an air of dignified reserve and devoted herself to her mother.\\nThis left Jo to her own devices, for Mrs. March had taken her place as\\nnurse, and bade her rest, exercise, and amuse herself after her long\\nconfinement.  Amy being gone, Laurie was her only refuge, and much as\\nshe enjoyed his society, she rather dreaded him just then, for he was\\nan incorrigible tease, and she feared he would coax the secret from her.\\n\\nShe was quite right, for the mischief-loving lad no sooner suspected a\\nmystery than he set himself to find it out, and led Jo a trying life of\\nit.  He wheedled, bribed, ridiculed, threatened, and scolded; affected\\nindifference, that he might surprise the truth from her; declared he\\nknew, then that he didn\\'t care; and at last, by dint of perseverance,\\nhe satisfied himself that it concerned Meg and Mr. Brooke.  Feeling\\nindignant that he was not taken into his tutor\\'s confidence, he set his\\nwits to work to devise some proper retaliation for the slight.\\n\\nMeg meanwhile had apparently forgotten the matter and was absorbed in\\npreparations for her father\\'s return, but all of a sudden a change\\nseemed to come over her, and, for a day or two, she was quite unlike\\nherself.  She started when spoken to, blushed when looked at, was very\\nquiet, and sat over her sewing, with a timid, troubled look on her\\nface.  To her mother\\'s inquiries she answered that she was quite well,\\nand Jo\\'s she silenced by begging to be let alone.\\n\\n\"She feels it in the air--love, I mean--and she\\'s going very fast.\\nShe\\'s got most of the symptoms--is twittery and cross, doesn\\'t eat,\\nlies awake, and mopes in corners.  I caught her singing that song he\\ngave her, and once she said \\'John\\', as you do, and then turned as red\\nas a poppy.  Whatever shall we do?\" said Jo, looking ready for any\\nmeasures, however violent.\\n\\n\"Nothing but wait.  Let her alone, be kind and patient, and Father\\'s\\ncoming will settle everything,\" replied her mother.\\n\\n\"Here\\'s a note to you, Meg, all sealed up.  How odd! Teddy never seals\\nmine,\" said Jo next day, as she distributed the contents of the little\\npost office.\\n\\nMrs. March and Jo were deep in their own affairs, when a sound from Meg\\nmade them look up to see her staring at her note with a frightened face.\\n\\n\"My child, what is it?\" cried her mother, running to her, while Jo\\ntried to take the paper which had done the mischief.\\n\\n\"It\\'s all a mistake, he didn\\'t send it.  Oh, Jo, how could you do it?\"\\nand Meg hid her face in her hands, crying as if her heart were quite\\nbroken.\\n\\n\"Me!  I\\'ve done nothing!  What\\'s she talking about?\" cried Jo,\\nbewildered.\\n\\nMeg\\'s mild eyes kindled with anger as she pulled a crumpled note from\\nher pocket and threw it at Jo, saying reproachfully, \"You wrote it, and\\nthat bad boy helped you.  How could you be so rude, so mean, and cruel\\nto us both?\"\\n\\nJo hardly heard her, for she and her mother were reading the note,\\nwhich was written in a peculiar hand.\\n\\n\\n\"My Dearest Margaret,\\n\\n\"I can no longer restrain my passion, and must know my fate before I\\nreturn.  I dare not tell your parents yet, but I think they would\\nconsent if they knew that we adored one another.  Mr. Laurence will\\nhelp me to some good place, and then, my sweet girl, you will make me\\nhappy.  I implore you to say nothing to your family yet, but to send\\none word of hope through Laurie to,\\n\\n\"Your devoted John.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, the little villain!  That\\'s the way he meant to pay me for keeping\\nmy word to Mother.  I\\'ll give him a hearty scolding and bring him over\\nto beg pardon,\" cried Jo, burning to execute immediate justice.  But\\nher mother held her back, saying, with a look she seldom wore...\\n\\n\"Stop, Jo, you must clear yourself first.  You have played so many\\npranks that I am afraid you have had a hand in this.\"\\n\\n\"On my word, Mother, I haven\\'t!  I never saw that note before, and\\ndon\\'t know anything about it, as true as I live!\" said Jo, so earnestly\\nthat they believed her.  \"If I had taken part in it I\\'d have done it\\nbetter than this, and have written a sensible note.  I should think\\nyou\\'d have known Mr. Brooke wouldn\\'t write such stuff as that,\" she\\nadded, scornfully tossing down the paper.\\n\\n\"It\\'s like his writing,\" faltered Meg, comparing it with the note in\\nher hand.\\n\\n\"Oh, Meg, you didn\\'t answer it?\" cried Mrs. March quickly.\\n\\n\"Yes, I did!\" and Meg hid her face again, overcome with shame.\\n\\n\"Here\\'s a scrape!  Do let me bring that wicked boy over to explain and\\nbe lectured.  I can\\'t rest till I get hold of him.\" And Jo made for the\\ndoor again.\\n\\n\"Hush!  Let me handle this, for it is worse than I thought. Margaret,\\ntell me the whole story,\" commanded Mrs. March, sitting down by Meg,\\nyet keeping hold of Jo, lest she should fly off.\\n\\n\"I received the first letter from Laurie, who didn\\'t look as if he knew\\nanything about it,\" began Meg, without looking up. \"I was worried at\\nfirst and meant to tell you, then I remembered how you liked Mr.\\nBrooke, so I thought you wouldn\\'t mind if I kept my little secret for a\\nfew days.  I\\'m so silly that I liked to think no one knew, and while I\\nwas deciding what to say, I felt like the girls in books, who have such\\nthings to do.  Forgive me, Mother, I\\'m paid for my silliness now.  I\\nnever can look him in the face again.\"\\n\\n\"What did you say to him?\" asked Mrs. March.\\n\\n\"I only said I was too young to do anything about it yet, that I didn\\'t\\nwish to have secrets from you, and he must speak to father.  I was very\\ngrateful for his kindness, and would be his friend, but nothing more,\\nfor a long while.\"\\n\\nMrs. March smiled, as if well pleased, and Jo clapped her hands,\\nexclaiming, with a laugh, \"You are almost equal to Caroline Percy, who\\nwas a pattern of prudence!  Tell on, Meg. What did he say to that?\"\\n\\n\"He writes in a different way entirely, telling me that he never sent\\nany love letter at all, and is very sorry that my roguish sister, Jo,\\nshould take liberties with our names.  It\\'s very kind and respectful,\\nbut think how dreadful for me!\"\\n\\nMeg leaned against her mother, looking the image of despair, and Jo\\ntramped about the room, calling Laurie names.  All of a sudden she\\nstopped, caught up the two notes, and after looking at them closely,\\nsaid decidedly, \"I don\\'t believe Brooke ever saw either of these\\nletters.  Teddy wrote both, and keeps yours to crow over me with\\nbecause I wouldn\\'t tell him my secret.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t have any secrets, Jo.  Tell it to Mother and keep out of\\ntrouble, as I should have done,\" said Meg warningly.\\n\\n\"Bless you, child!  Mother told me.\"\\n\\n\"That will do, Jo.  I\\'ll comfort Meg while you go and get Laurie.  I\\nshall sift the matter to the bottom, and put a stop to such pranks at\\nonce.\"\\n\\nAway ran Jo, and Mrs. March gently told Meg Mr. Brooke\\'s real feelings.\\n\"Now, dear, what are your own?  Do you love him enough to wait till he\\ncan make a home for you, or will you keep yourself quite free for the\\npresent?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been so scared and worried, I don\\'t want to have anything to do\\nwith lovers for a long while, perhaps never,\" answered Meg petulantly.\\n\"If John doesn\\'t know anything about this nonsense, don\\'t tell him, and\\nmake Jo and Laurie hold their tongues.  I won\\'t be deceived and plagued\\nand made a fool of. It\\'s a shame!\"\\n\\nSeeing Meg\\'s usually gentle temper was roused and her pride hurt by\\nthis mischievous joke, Mrs. March soothed her by promises of entire\\nsilence and great discretion for the future.  The instant Laurie\\'s step\\nwas heard in the hall, Meg fled into the study, and Mrs. March received\\nthe culprit alone. Jo had not told him why he was wanted, fearing he\\nwouldn\\'t come, but he knew the minute he saw Mrs. March\\'s face, and\\nstood twirling his hat with a guilty air which convicted him at once.\\nJo was dismissed, but chose to march up and down the hall like a\\nsentinel, having some fear that the prisoner might bolt.  The sound of\\nvoices in the parlor rose and fell for half an hour, but what happened\\nduring that interview the girls never knew.\\n\\nWhen they were called in, Laurie was standing by their mother with such\\na penitent face that Jo forgave him on the spot, but did not think it\\nwise to betray the fact.  Meg received his humble apology, and was much\\ncomforted by the assurance that Brooke knew nothing of the joke.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll never tell him to my dying day, wild horses shan\\'t drag it out of\\nme, so you\\'ll forgive me, Meg, and I\\'ll do anything to show how\\nout-and-out sorry I am,\" he added, looking very much ashamed of himself.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll try, but it was a very ungentlemanly thing to do, I didn\\'t think\\nyou could be so sly and malicious, Laurie,\" replied Meg, trying to hide\\nher maidenly confusion under a gravely reproachful air.\\n\\n\"It was altogether abominable, and I don\\'t deserve to be spoken to for\\na month, but you will, though, won\\'t you?\" And Laurie folded his hands\\ntogether with such and imploring gesture, as he spoke in his\\nirresistibly persuasive tone, that it was impossible to frown upon him\\nin spite of his scandalous behavior.\\n\\nMeg pardoned him, and Mrs. March\\'s grave face relaxed, in spite of her\\nefforts to keep sober, when she heard him declare that he would atone\\nfor his sins by all sorts of penances, and abase himself like a worm\\nbefore the injured damsel.\\n\\nJo stood aloof, meanwhile, trying to harden her heart against him, and\\nsucceeding only in primming up her face into an expression of entire\\ndisapprobation.  Laurie looked at her once or twice, but as she showed\\nno sign of relenting, he felt injured, and turned his back on her till\\nthe others were done with him, when he made her a low bow and walked\\noff without a word.\\n\\nAs soon as he had gone, she wished she had been more forgiving, and\\nwhen Meg and her mother went upstairs, she felt lonely and longed for\\nTeddy.  After resisting for some time, she yielded to the impulse, and\\narmed with a book to return, went over to the big house.\\n\\n\"Is Mr. Laurence in?\" asked Jo, of a housemaid, who was coming\\ndownstairs.\\n\\n\"Yes, Miss, but I don\\'t believe he\\'s seeable just yet.\"\\n\\n\"Why not?  Is he ill?\"\\n\\n\"La, no Miss, but he\\'s had a scene with Mr. Laurie, who is in one of\\nhis tantrums about something, which vexes the old gentleman, so I\\ndursn\\'t go nigh him.\"\\n\\n\"Where is Laurie?\"\\n\\n\"Shut up in his room, and he won\\'t answer, though I\\'ve been a-tapping.\\nI don\\'t know what\\'s to become of the dinner, for it\\'s ready, and\\nthere\\'s no one to eat it.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll go and see what the matter is.  I\\'m not afraid of either of them.\"\\n\\nUp went Jo, and knocked smartly on the door of Laurie\\'s little study.\\n\\n\"Stop that, or I\\'ll open the door and make you!\" called out the young\\ngentleman in a threatening tone.\\n\\nJo immediately knocked again.  The door flew open, and in she bounced\\nbefore Laurie could recover from his surprise.  Seeing that he really\\nwas out of temper, Jo, who knew how to manage him, assumed a contrite\\nexpression, and going artistically down upon her knees, said meekly,\\n\"Please forgive me for being so cross.  I came to make it up, and can\\'t\\ngo away till I have.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s all right.  Get up, and don\\'t be a goose, Jo,\" was the cavalier\\nreply to her petition.\\n\\n\"Thank you, I will.  Could I ask what\\'s the matter?  You don\\'t look\\nexactly easy in your mind.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been shaken, and I won\\'t bear it!\" growled Laurie indignantly.\\n\\n\"Who did it?\" demanded Jo.\\n\\n\"Grandfather.  If it had been anyone else I\\'d have...\" And the injured\\nyouth finished his sentence by an energetic gesture of the right arm.\\n\\n\"That\\'s nothing.  I often shake you, and you don\\'t mind,\" said Jo\\nsoothingly.\\n\\n\"Pooh!  You\\'re a girl, and it\\'s fun, but I\\'ll allow no man to shake me!\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think anyone would care to try it, if you looked as much like\\na thundercloud as you do now.  Why were you treated so?\"\\n\\n\"Just because I wouldn\\'t say what your mother wanted me for. I\\'d\\npromised not to tell, and of course I wasn\\'t going to break my word.\"\\n\\n\"Couldn\\'t you satisfy your grandpa in any other way?\"\\n\\n\"No, he would have the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\\ntruth.  I\\'d have told my part of the scrape, if I could without\\nbringing Meg in.  As I couldn\\'t, I held my tongue, and bore the\\nscolding till the old gentleman collared me.  Then I bolted, for fear I\\nshould forget myself.\"\\n\\n\"It wasn\\'t nice, but he\\'s sorry, I know, so go down and make up.  I\\'ll\\nhelp you.\"\\n\\n\"Hanged if I do!  I\\'m not going to be lectured and pummelled by\\neveryone, just for a bit of a frolic.  I was sorry about Meg, and\\nbegged pardon like a man, but I won\\'t do it again, when I wasn\\'t in the\\nwrong.\"\\n\\n\"He didn\\'t know that.\"\\n\\n\"He ought to trust me, and not act as if I was a baby.  It\\'s no use,\\nJo, he\\'s got to learn that I\\'m able to take care of myself, and don\\'t\\nneed anyone\\'s apron string to hold on by.\"\\n\\n\"What pepper pots you are!\" sighed Jo.  \"How do you mean to settle this\\naffair?\"\\n\\n\"Well, he ought to beg pardon, and believe me when I say I can\\'t tell\\nhim what the fuss\\'s about.\"\\n\\n\"Bless you!  He won\\'t do that.\"\\n\\n\"I won\\'t go down till he does.\"\\n\\n\"Now, Teddy, be sensible.  Let it pass, and I\\'ll explain what I can.\\nYou can\\'t stay here, so what\\'s the use of being melodramatic?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t intend to stay here long, anyway.  I\\'ll slip off and take a\\njourney somewhere, and when Grandpa misses me he\\'ll come round fast\\nenough.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say, but you ought not to go and worry him.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t preach.  I\\'ll go to Washington and see Brooke.  It\\'s gay there,\\nand I\\'ll enjoy myself after the troubles.\"\\n\\n\"What fun you\\'d have!  I wish I could run off too,\" said Jo, forgetting\\nher part of mentor in lively visions of martial life at the capital.\\n\\n\"Come on, then!  Why not?  You go and surprise your father, and I\\'ll\\nstir up old Brooke.  It would be a glorious joke.  Let\\'s do it, Jo.\\nWe\\'ll leave a letter saying we are all right, and trot off at once.\\nI\\'ve got money enough.  It will do you good, and no harm, as you go to\\nyour father.\"\\n\\nFor a moment Jo looked as if she would agree, for wild as the plan was,\\nit just suited her.  She was tired of care and confinement, longed for\\nchange, and thoughts of her father blended temptingly with the novel\\ncharms of camps and hospitals, liberty and fun.  Her eyes kindled as\\nthey turned wistfully toward the window, but they fell on the old house\\nopposite, and she shook her head with sorrowful decision.\\n\\n\"If I was a boy, we\\'d run away together, and have a capital time, but\\nas I\\'m a miserable girl, I must be proper and stop at home. Don\\'t tempt\\nme, Teddy, it\\'s a crazy plan.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s the fun of it,\" began Laurie, who had got a willful fit on him\\nand was possessed to break out of bounds in some way.\\n\\n\"Hold your tongue!\" cried Jo, covering her ears.  \"\\'Prunes and prisms\\'\\nare my doom, and I may as well make up my mind to it.  I came here to\\nmoralize, not to hear things that make me skip to think of.\"\\n\\n\"I know Meg would wet-blanket such a proposal, but I thought you had\\nmore spirit,\" began Laurie insinuatingly.\\n\\n\"Bad boy, be quiet!  Sit down and think of your own sins, don\\'t go\\nmaking me add to mine.  If I get your grandpa to apologize for the\\nshaking, will you give up running away?\" asked Jo seriously.\\n\\n\"Yes, but you won\\'t do it,\" answered Laurie, who wished to make up, but\\nfelt that his outraged dignity must be appeased first.\\n\\n\"If I can manage the young one, I can the old one,\" muttered Jo, as she\\nwalked away, leaving Laurie bent over a railroad map with his head\\npropped up on both hands.\\n\\n\"Come in!\" and Mr. Laurence\\'s gruff voice sounded gruffer than ever, as\\nJo tapped at his door.\\n\\n\"It\\'s only me, Sir, come to return a book,\" she said blandly, as she\\nentered.\\n\\n\"Want any more?\" asked the old gentleman, looking grim and vexed, but\\ntrying not to show it.\\n\\n\"Yes, please.  I like old Sam so well, I think I\\'ll try the second\\nvolume,\" returned Jo, hoping to propitiate him by accepting a second\\ndose of Boswell\\'s Johnson, as he had recommended that lively work.\\n\\nThe shaggy eyebrows unbent a little as he rolled the steps toward the\\nshelf where the Johnsonian literature was placed.  Jo skipped up, and\\nsitting on the top step, affected to be searching for her book, but was\\nreally wondering how best to introduce the dangerous object of her\\nvisit.  Mr. Laurence seemed to suspect that something was brewing in\\nher mind, for after taking several brisk turns about the room, he faced\\nround on her, speaking so abruptly that Rasselas tumbled face downward\\non the floor.\\n\\n\"What has that boy been about?  Don\\'t try to shield him.  I know he has\\nbeen in mischief by the way he acted when he came home.  I can\\'t get a\\nword from him, and when I threatened to shake the truth out of him he\\nbolted upstairs and locked himself into his room.\"\\n\\n\"He did wrong, but we forgave him, and all promised not to say a word\\nto anyone,\" began Jo reluctantly.\\n\\n\"That won\\'t do.  He shall not shelter himself behind a promise from you\\nsofthearted girls.  If he\\'s done anything amiss, he shall confess, beg\\npardon, and be punished.  Out with it, Jo. I won\\'t be kept in the dark.\"\\n\\nMr. Laurence looked so alarming and spoke so sharply that Jo would have\\ngladly run away, if she could, but she was perched aloft on the steps,\\nand he stood at the foot, a lion in the path, so she had to stay and\\nbrave it out.\\n\\n\"Indeed, Sir, I cannot tell.  Mother forbade it.  Laurie has confessed,\\nasked pardon, and been punished quite enough.  We don\\'t keep silence to\\nshield him, but someone else, and it will make more trouble if you\\ninterfere.  Please don\\'t.  It was partly my fault, but it\\'s all right\\nnow.  So let\\'s forget it, and talk about the _Rambler_ or something\\npleasant.\"\\n\\n\"Hang the _Rambler!_  Come down and give me your word that this\\nharum-scarum boy of mine hasn\\'t done anything ungrateful or\\nimpertinent.  If he has, after all your kindness to him, I\\'ll thrash\\nhim with my own hands.\"\\n\\nThe threat sounded awful, but did not alarm Jo, for she knew the\\nirascible old gentleman would never lift a finger against his grandson,\\nwhatever he might say to the contrary.  She obediently descended, and\\nmade as light of the prank as she could without betraying Meg or\\nforgetting the truth.\\n\\n\"Hum... ha... well, if the boy held his tongue because he promised, and\\nnot from obstinacy, I\\'ll forgive him. He\\'s a stubborn fellow and hard\\nto manage,\" said Mr. Laurence, rubbing up his hair till it looked as if\\nhe had been out in a gale, and smoothing the frown from his brow with\\nan air of relief.\\n\\n\"So am I, but a kind word will govern me when all the king\\'s horses and\\nall the king\\'s men couldn\\'t,\" said Jo, trying to say a kind word for\\nher friend, who seemed to get out of one scrape only to fall into\\nanother.\\n\\n\"You think I\\'m not kind to him, hey?\" was the sharp answer.\\n\\n\"Oh, dear no, Sir.  You are rather too kind sometimes, and then just a\\ntrifle hasty when he tries your patience.  Don\\'t you think you are?\"\\n\\nJo was determined to have it out now, and tried to look quite placid,\\nthough she quaked a little after her bold speech. To her great relief\\nand surprise, the old gentleman only threw his spectacles onto the\\ntable with a rattle and exclaimed frankly, \"You\\'re right, girl, I am!\\nI love the boy, but he tries my patience past bearing, and I know how\\nit will end, if we go on so.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll tell you, he\\'ll run away.\" Jo was sorry for that speech the\\nminute it was made.  She meant to warn him that Laurie would not bear\\nmuch restraint, and hoped he would be more forebearing with the lad.\\n\\nMr. Laurence\\'s ruddy face changed suddenly, and he sat down, with a\\ntroubled glance at the picture of a handsome man, which hung over his\\ntable.  It was Laurie\\'s father, who had run away in his youth, and\\nmarried against the imperious old man\\'s will. Jo fancied he remembered\\nand regretted the past, and she wished she had held her tongue.\\n\\n\"He won\\'t do it unless he is very much worried, and only threatens it\\nsometimes, when he gets tired of studying.  I often think I should like\\nto, especially since my hair was cut, so if you ever miss us, you may\\nadvertise for two boys and look among the ships bound for India.\"\\n\\nShe laughed as she spoke, and Mr. Laurence looked relieved, evidently\\ntaking the whole as a joke.\\n\\n\"You hussy, how dare you talk in that way?  Where\\'s your respect for\\nme, and your proper bringing up?  Bless the boys and girls!  What\\ntorments they are, yet we can\\'t do without them,\" he said, pinching her\\ncheeks good-humoredly.  \"Go and bring that boy down to his dinner, tell\\nhim it\\'s all right, and advise him not to put on tragedy airs with his\\ngrandfather.  I won\\'t bear it.\"\\n\\n\"He won\\'t come, Sir.  He feels badly because you didn\\'t believe him\\nwhen he said he couldn\\'t tell.  I think the shaking hurt his feelings\\nvery much.\"\\n\\nJo tried to look pathetic but must have failed, for Mr. Laurence began\\nto laugh, and she knew the day was won.\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry for that, and ought to thank him for not shaking me, I\\nsuppose.  What the dickens does the fellow expect?\" and the old\\ngentleman looked a trifle ashamed of his own testiness.\\n\\n\"If I were you, I\\'d write him an apology, Sir.  He says he won\\'t come\\ndown till he has one, and talks about Washington, and goes on in an\\nabsurd way.  A formal apology will make him see how foolish he is, and\\nbring him down quite amiable.  Try it.  He likes fun, and this way is\\nbetter than talking.  I\\'ll carry it up, and teach him his duty.\"\\n\\nMr. Laurence gave her a sharp look, and put on his spectacles, saying\\nslowly, \"You\\'re a sly puss, but I don\\'t mind being managed by you and\\nBeth.  Here, give me a bit of paper, and let us have done with this\\nnonsense.\"\\n\\nThe note was written in the terms which one gentleman would use to\\nanother after offering some deep insult.  Jo dropped a kiss on the top\\nof Mr. Laurence\\'s bald head, and ran up to slip the apology under\\nLaurie\\'s door, advising him through the keyhole to be submissive,\\ndecorous, and a few other agreeable impossibilities. Finding the door\\nlocked again, she left the note to do its work, and was going quietly\\naway, when the young gentleman slid down the banisters, and waited for\\nher at the bottom, saying, with his most virtuous expression of\\ncountenance, \"What a good fellow you are, Jo! Did you get blown up?\" he\\nadded, laughing.\\n\\n\"No, he was pretty mild, on the whole.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!  I got it all round.  Even you cast me off over there, and I felt\\njust ready to go to the deuce,\" he began apologetically.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t talk that way, turn over a new leaf and begin again, Teddy, my\\nson.\"\\n\\n\"I keep turning over new leaves, and spoiling them, as I used to spoil\\nmy copybooks, and I make so many beginnings there never will be an\\nend,\" he said dolefully.\\n\\n\"Go and eat your dinner, you\\'ll feel better after it.  Men always croak\\nwhen they are hungry,\" and Jo whisked out at the front door after that.\\n\\n\"That\\'s a \\'label\\' on my \\'sect\\',\" answered Laurie, quoting Amy, as he\\nwent to partake of humble pie dutifully with his grandfather, who was\\nquite saintly in temper and overwhelmingly respectful in manner all the\\nrest of the day.\\n\\nEveryone thought the matter ended and the little cloud blown over, but\\nthe mischief was done, for though others forgot it, Meg remembered.\\nShe never alluded to a certain person, but she thought of him a good\\ndeal, dreamed dreams more than ever, and once Jo, rummaging her\\nsister\\'s desk for stamps, found a bit of paper scribbled over with the\\nwords, \\'Mrs. John Brooke\\', whereat she groaned tragically and cast it\\ninto the fire, feeling that Laurie\\'s prank had hastened the evil day\\nfor her.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'TWENTY-TWO\\n\\nPLEASANT MEADOWS\\n\\nLike sunshine after a storm were the peaceful weeks which followed.\\nThe invalids improved rapidly, and Mr. March began to talk of returning\\nearly in the new year.  Beth was soon able to lie on the study sofa all\\nday, amusing herself with the well-beloved cats at first, and in time\\nwith doll\\'s sewing, which had fallen sadly behind-hand.  Her once\\nactive limbs were so stiff and feeble that Jo took her for a daily\\nairing about the house in her strong arms.  Meg cheerfully blackened\\nand burned her white hands cooking delicate messes for \\'the dear\\',\\nwhile Amy, a loyal slave of the ring, celebrated her return by giving\\naway as many of her treasures as she could prevail on her sisters to\\naccept.\\n\\nAs Christmas approached, the usual mysteries began to haunt the house,\\nand Jo frequently convulsed the family by proposing utterly impossible\\nor magnificently absurd ceremonies, in honor of this unusually merry\\nChristmas.  Laurie was equally impracticable, and would have had\\nbonfires, skyrockets, and triumphal arches, if he had had his own way.\\nAfter many skirmishes and snubbings, the ambitious pair were considered\\neffectually quenched and went about with forlorn faces, which were\\nrather belied by explosions of laughter when the two got together.\\n\\nSeveral days of unusually mild weather fitly ushered in a splendid\\nChristmas Day.  Hannah \\'felt in her bones\\' that it was going to be an\\nunusually fine day, and she proved herself a true prophetess, for\\neverybody and everything seemed bound to produce a grand success.  To\\nbegin with, Mr. March wrote that he should soon be with them, then Beth\\nfelt uncommonly well that morning, and, being dressed in her mother\\'s\\ngift, a soft crimson merino wrapper, was borne in high triumph to the\\nwindow to behold the offering of Jo and Laurie.  The Unquenchables had\\ndone their best to be worthy of the name, for like elves they had\\nworked by night and conjured up a comical surprise.  Out in the garden\\nstood a stately snow maiden, crowned with holly, bearing a basket of\\nfruit and flowers in one hand, a great roll of music in the other, a\\nperfect rainbow of an Afghan round her chilly shoulders, and a\\nChristmas carol issuing from her lips on a pink paper streamer.\\n\\n    THE JUNGFRAU TO BETH\\n\\n    God bless you, dear Queen Bess!\\n    May nothing you dismay,\\n    But health and peace and happiness\\n    Be yours, this Christmas day.\\n\\n    Here\\'s fruit to feed our busy bee,\\n    And flowers for her nose.\\n    Here\\'s music for her pianee,\\n    An afghan for her toes,\\n\\n    A portrait of Joanna, see,\\n    By Raphael No. 2,\\n    Who laboured with great industry\\n    To make it fair and true.\\n\\n    Accept a ribbon red, I beg,\\n    For Madam Purrer\\'s tail,\\n    And ice cream made by lovely Peg,\\n    A Mont Blanc in a pail.\\n\\n    Their dearest love my makers laid\\n    Within my breast of snow.\\n    Accept it, and the Alpine maid,\\n    From Laurie and from Jo.\\n\\nHow Beth laughed when she saw it, how Laurie ran up and down to bring\\nin the gifts, and what ridiculous speeches Jo made as she presented\\nthem.\\n\\n\"I\\'m so full of happiness, that if Father was only here, I couldn\\'t\\nhold one drop more,\" said Beth, quite sighing with contentment as Jo\\ncarried her off to the study to rest after the excitement, and to\\nrefresh herself with some of the delicious grapes the \\'Jungfrau\\' had\\nsent her.\\n\\n\"So am I,\" added Jo, slapping the pocket wherein reposed the\\nlong-desired _Undine and Sintram_.\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure I am,\" echoed Amy, poring over the engraved copy of the\\nMadonna and Child, which her mother had given her in a pretty frame.\\n\\n\"Of course I am!\" cried Meg, smoothing the silvery folds of her first\\nsilk dress, for Mr. Laurence had insisted on giving it. \"How can I be\\notherwise?\" said Mrs. March gratefully, as her eyes went from her\\nhusband\\'s letter to Beth\\'s smiling face, and her hand caressed the\\nbrooch made of gray and golden, chestnut and dark brown hair, which the\\ngirls had just fastened on her breast.\\n\\nNow and then, in this workaday world, things do happen in the\\ndelightful storybook fashion, and what a comfort it is.  Half an hour\\nafter everyone had said they were so happy they could only hold one\\ndrop more, the drop came.  Laurie opened the parlor door and popped his\\nhead in very quietly.  He might just as well have turned a somersault\\nand uttered an Indian war whoop, for his face was so full of suppressed\\nexcitement and his voice so treacherously joyful that everyone jumped\\nup, though he only said, in a queer, breathless voice, \"Here\\'s another\\nChristmas present for the March family.\"\\n\\nBefore the words were well out of his mouth, he was whisked away\\nsomehow, and in his place appeared a tall man, muffled up to the eyes,\\nleaning on the arm of another tall man, who tried to say something and\\ncouldn\\'t.  Of course there was a general stampede, and for several\\nminutes everybody seemed to lose their wits, for the strangest things\\nwere done, and no one said a word.\\n\\nMr. March became invisible in the embrace of four pairs of loving arms.\\nJo disgraced herself by nearly fainting away, and had to be doctored by\\nLaurie in the china closet.  Mr. Brooke kissed Meg entirely by mistake,\\nas he somewhat incoherently explained.  And Amy, the dignified, tumbled\\nover a stool, and never stopping to get up, hugged and cried over her\\nfather\\'s boots in the most touching manner.  Mrs. March was the first\\nto recover herself, and held up her hand with a warning, \"Hush!\\nRemember Beth.\"\\n\\nBut it was too late.  The study door flew open, the little red wrapper\\nappeared on the threshold, joy put strength into the feeble limbs, and\\nBeth ran straight into her father\\'s arms.  Never mind what happened\\njust after that, for the full hearts overflowed, washing away the\\nbitterness of the past and leaving only the sweetness of the present.\\n\\nIt was not at all romantic, but a hearty laugh set everybody straight\\nagain, for Hannah was discovered behind the door, sobbing over the fat\\nturkey, which she had forgotten to put down when she rushed up from the\\nkitchen.  As the laugh subsided, Mrs. March began to thank Mr. Brooke\\nfor his faithful care of her husband, at which Mr. Brooke suddenly\\nremembered that Mr. March needed rest, and seizing Laurie, he\\nprecipitately retired.  Then the two invalids were ordered to repose,\\nwhich they did, by both sitting in one big chair and talking hard.\\n\\nMr. March told how he had longed to surprise them, and how, when the\\nfine weather came, he had been allowed by his doctor to take advantage\\nof it, how devoted Brooke had been, and how he was altogether a most\\nestimable and upright young man.  Why Mr. March paused a minute just\\nthere, and after a glance at Meg, who was violently poking the fire,\\nlooked at his wife with an inquiring lift of the eyebrows, I leave you\\nto imagine.  Also why Mrs. March gently nodded her head and asked,\\nrather abruptly, if he wouldn\\'t like to have something to eat.  Jo saw\\nand understood the look, and she stalked grimly away to get wine and\\nbeef tea, muttering to herself as she slammed the door, \"I hate\\nestimable young men with brown eyes!\"\\n\\nThere never was such a Christmas dinner as they had that day. The fat\\nturkey was a sight to behold, when Hannah sent him up, stuffed,\\nbrowned, and decorated.  So was the plum pudding, which melted in one\\'s\\nmouth, likewise the jellies, in which Amy reveled like a fly in a\\nhoneypot.  Everything turned out well, which was a mercy, Hannah said,\\n\"For my mind was that flustered, Mum, that it\\'s a merrycle I didn\\'t\\nroast the pudding, and stuff the turkey with raisins, let alone bilin\\'\\nof it in a cloth.\"\\n\\nMr. Laurence and his grandson dined with them, also Mr. Brooke, at whom\\nJo glowered darkly, to Laurie\\'s infinite amusement. Two easy chairs\\nstood side by side at the head of the table, in which sat Beth and her\\nfather, feasting modestly on chicken and a little fruit.  They drank\\nhealths, told stories, sang songs, \\'reminisced\\', as the old folks say,\\nand had a thoroughly good time. A sleigh ride had been planned, but the\\ngirls would not leave their father, so the guests departed early, and\\nas twilight gathered, the happy family sat together round the fire.\\n\\n\"Just a year ago we were groaning over the dismal Christmas we expected\\nto have.  Do you remember?\" asked Jo, breaking a short pause which had\\nfollowed a long conversation about many things.\\n\\n\"Rather a pleasant year on the whole!\" said Meg, smiling at the fire,\\nand congratulating herself on having treated Mr. Brooke with dignity.\\n\\n\"I think it\\'s been a pretty hard one,\" observed Amy, watching the light\\nshine on her ring with thoughtful eyes.\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad it\\'s over, because we\\'ve got you back,\" whispered Beth, who\\nsat on her father\\'s knee.\\n\\n\"Rather a rough road for you to travel, my little pilgrims, especially\\nthe latter part of it.  But you have got on bravely, and I think the\\nburdens are in a fair way to tumble off very soon,\" said Mr. March,\\nlooking with fatherly satisfaction at the four young faces gathered\\nround him.\\n\\n\"How do you know?  Did Mother tell you?\" asked Jo.\\n\\n\"Not much.  Straws show which way the wind blows, and I\\'ve made several\\ndiscoveries today.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, tell us what they are!\" cried Meg, who sat beside him.\\n\\n\"Here is one.\" And taking up the hand which lay on the arm of his\\nchair, he pointed to the roughened forefinger, a burn on the back, and\\ntwo or three little hard spots on the palm.  \"I remember a time when\\nthis hand was white and smooth, and your first care was to keep it so.\\nIt was very pretty then, but to me it is much prettier now, for in this\\nseeming blemishes I read a little history.  A burnt offering has been\\nmade to vanity, this hardened palm has earned something better than\\nblisters, and I\\'m sure the sewing done by these pricked fingers will\\nlast a long time, so much good will went into the stitches.  Meg, my\\ndear, I value the womanly skill which keeps home happy more than white\\nhands or fashionable accomplishments.  I\\'m proud to shake this good,\\nindustrious little hand, and hope I shall not soon be asked to give it\\naway.\"\\n\\nIf Meg had wanted a reward for hours of patient labor, she received it\\nin the hearty pressure of her father\\'s hand and the approving smile he\\ngave her.\\n\\n\"What about Jo?  Please say something nice, for she has tried so hard\\nand been so very, very good to me,\" said Beth in her father\\'s ear.\\n\\nHe laughed and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite, with an\\nunusually mild expression in her face.\\n\\n\"In spite of the curly crop, I don\\'t see the \\'son Jo\\' whom I left a\\nyear ago,\" said Mr. March.  \"I see a young lady who pins her collar\\nstraight, laces her boots neatly, and neither whistles, talks slang,\\nnor lies on the rug as she used to do.  Her face is rather thin and\\npale just now, with watching and anxiety, but I like to look at it, for\\nit has grown gentler, and her voice is lower.  She doesn\\'t bounce, but\\nmoves quietly, and takes care of a certain little person in a motherly\\nway which delights me.  I rather miss my wild girl, but if I get a\\nstrong, helpful, tenderhearted woman in her place, I shall feel quite\\nsatisfied. I don\\'t know whether the shearing sobered our black sheep,\\nbut I do know that in all Washington I couldn\\'t find anything beautiful\\nenough to be bought with the five-and-twenty dollars my good girl sent\\nme.\"\\n\\nJo\\'s keen eyes were rather dim for a minute, and her thin face grew\\nrosy in the firelight as she received her father\\'s praise, feeling that\\nshe did deserve a portion of it.\\n\\n\"Now, Beth,\" said Amy, longing for her turn, but ready to wait.\\n\\n\"There\\'s so little of her, I\\'m afraid to say much, for fear she will\\nslip away altogether, though she is not so shy as she used to be,\"\\nbegan their father cheerfully.  But recollecting how nearly he had lost\\nher, he held her close, saying tenderly, with her cheek against his\\nown, \"I\\'ve got you safe, my Beth, and I\\'ll keep you so, please God.\"\\n\\nAfter a minute\\'s silence, he looked down at Amy, who sat on the cricket\\nat his feet, and said, with a caress of the shining hair...\\n\\n\"I observed that Amy took drumsticks at dinner, ran errands for her\\nmother all the afternoon, gave Meg her place tonight, and has waited on\\nevery one with patience and good humor.  I also observe that she does\\nnot fret much nor look in the glass, and has not even mentioned a very\\npretty ring which she wears, so I conclude that she has learned to\\nthink of other people more and of herself less, and has decided to try\\nand mold her character as carefully as she molds her little clay\\nfigures.  I am glad of this, for though I should be very proud of a\\ngraceful statue made by her, I shall be infinitely prouder of a lovable\\ndaughter with a talent for making life beautiful to herself and others.\"\\n\\n\"What are you thinking of, Beth?\" asked Jo, when Amy had thanked her\\nfather and told about her ring.\\n\\n\"I read in _Pilgrim\\'s Progress_ today how, after many troubles,\\nChristian and Hopeful came to a pleasant green meadow where lilies\\nbloomed all year round, and there they rested happily, as we do now,\\nbefore they went on to their journey\\'s end,\" answered Beth, adding, as\\nshe slipped out of her father\\'s arms and went to the instrument, \"It\\'s\\nsinging time now, and I want to be in my old place.  I\\'ll try to sing\\nthe song of the shepherd boy which the Pilgrims heard.  I made the\\nmusic for Father, because he likes the verses.\"\\n\\nSo, sitting at the dear little piano, Beth softly touched the keys, and\\nin the sweet voice they had never thought to hear again, sang to her\\nown accompaniment the quaint hymn, which was a singularly fitting song\\nfor her.\\n\\n\\n    He that is down need fear no fall,\\n    He that is low no pride.\\n    He that is humble ever shall\\n    Have God to be his guide.\\n\\n    I am content with what I have,\\n    Little be it, or much.\\n    And, Lord!  Contentment still I crave,\\n    Because Thou savest such.\\n\\n    Fulness to them a burden is,\\n    That go on pilgrimage.\\n    Here little, and hereafter bliss,\\n    Is best from age to age!\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'TWENTY-THREE\\n\\nAUNT MARCH SETTLES THE QUESTION\\n\\nLike bees swarming after their queen, mother and daughters hovered\\nabout Mr. March the next day, neglecting everything to look at, wait\\nupon, and listen to the new invalid, who was in a fair way to be killed\\nby kindness.  As he sat propped up in a big chair by Beth\\'s sofa, with\\nthe other three close by, and Hannah popping in her head now and then\\n\\'to peek at the dear man\\', nothing seemed needed to complete their\\nhappiness.  But something was needed, and the elder ones felt it,\\nthough none confessed the fact.  Mr. and Mrs. March looked at one\\nanother with an anxious expression, as their eyes followed Meg.  Jo had\\nsudden fits of sobriety, and was seen to shake her fist at Mr. Brooke\\'s\\numbrella, which had been left in the hall.  Meg was absent-minded, shy,\\nand silent, started when the bell rang, and colored when John\\'s name\\nwas mentioned.  Amy said, \"Everyone seemed waiting for something, and\\ncouldn\\'t settle down, which was queer, since Father was safe at home,\"\\nand Beth innocently wondered why their neighbors didn\\'t run over as\\nusual.\\n\\nLaurie went by in the afternoon, and seeing Meg at the window, seemed\\nsuddenly possessed with a melodramatic fit, for he fell down on one\\nknee in the snow, beat his breast, tore his hair, and clasped his hands\\nimploringly, as if begging some boon. And when Meg told him to behave\\nhimself and go away, he wrung imaginary tears out of his handkerchief,\\nand staggered round the corner as if in utter despair.\\n\\n\"What does the goose mean?\" said Meg, laughing and trying to look\\nunconscious.\\n\\n\"He\\'s showing you how your John will go on by-and-by. Touching, isn\\'t\\nit?\" answered Jo scornfully.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t say my John, it isn\\'t proper or true,\" but Meg\\'s voice lingered\\nover the words as if they sounded pleasant to her.  \"Please don\\'t\\nplague me, Jo, I\\'ve told you I don\\'t care much about him, and there\\nisn\\'t to be anything said, but we are all to be friendly, and go on as\\nbefore.\"\\n\\n\"We can\\'t, for something has been said, and Laurie\\'s mischief has\\nspoiled you for me.  I see it, and so does Mother.  You are not like\\nyour old self a bit, and seem ever so far away from me.  I don\\'t mean\\nto plague you and will bear it like a man, but I do wish it was all\\nsettled.  I hate to wait, so if you mean ever to do it, make haste and\\nhave it over quickly,\" said Jo pettishly.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t say anything till he speaks, and he won\\'t, because Father said\\nI was too young,\" began Meg, bending over her work with a queer little\\nsmile, which suggested that she did not quite agree with her father on\\nthat point.\\n\\n\"If he did speak, you wouldn\\'t know what to say, but would cry or\\nblush, or let him have his own way, instead of giving a good, decided\\nno.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not so silly and weak as you think.  I know just what I should\\nsay, for I\\'ve planned it all, so I needn\\'t be taken unawares.  There\\'s\\nno knowing what may happen, and I wished to be prepared.\"\\n\\nJo couldn\\'t help smiling at the important air which Meg had\\nunconsciously assumed and which was as becoming as the pretty color\\nvarying in her cheeks.\\n\\n\"Would you mind telling me what you\\'d say?\" asked Jo more respectfully.\\n\\n\"Not at all.  You are sixteen now, quite old enough to be my confidant,\\nand my experience will be useful to you by-and-by, perhaps, in your own\\naffairs of this sort.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t mean to have any.  It\\'s fun to watch other people philander, but\\nI should feel like a fool doing it myself,\" said Jo, looking alarmed at\\nthe thought.\\n\\n\"I think not, if you liked anyone very much, and he liked you.\"  Meg\\nspoke as if to herself, and glanced out at the lane where she had often\\nseen lovers walking together in the summer twilight.\\n\\n\"I thought you were going to tell your speech to that man,\" said Jo,\\nrudely shortening her sister\\'s little reverie.\\n\\n\"Oh, I should merely say, quite calmly and decidedly, \\'Thank you, Mr.\\nBrooke, you are very kind, but I agree with Father that I am too young\\nto enter into any engagement at present, so please say no more, but let\\nus be friends as we were.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Hum, that\\'s stiff and cool enough!  I don\\'t believe you\\'ll ever say\\nit, and I know he won\\'t be satisfied if you do.  If he goes on like the\\nrejected lovers in books, you\\'ll give in, rather than hurt his\\nfeelings.\"\\n\\n\"No, I won\\'t.  I shall tell him I\\'ve made up my mind, and shall walk\\nout of the room with dignity.\"\\n\\nMeg rose as she spoke, and was just going to rehearse the dignified\\nexit, when a step in the hall made her fly into her seat and begin to\\nsew as fast as if her life depended on finishing that particular seam\\nin a given time.  Jo smothered a laugh at the sudden change, and when\\nsomeone gave a modest tap, opened the door with a grim aspect which was\\nanything but hospitable.\\n\\n\"Good afternoon.  I came to get my umbrella, that is, to see how your\\nfather finds himself today,\" said Mr. Brooke, getting a trifle confused\\nas his eyes went from one telltale face to the other.\\n\\n\"It\\'s very well, he\\'s in the rack.  I\\'ll get him, and tell it you are\\nhere.\"  And having jumbled her father and the umbrella well together in\\nher reply, Jo slipped out of the room to give Meg a chance to make her\\nspeech and air her dignity.  But the instant she vanished, Meg began to\\nsidle toward the door, murmuring...\\n\\n\"Mother will like to see you.  Pray sit down, I\\'ll call her.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t go.  Are you afraid of me, Margaret?\" and Mr. Brooke looked so\\nhurt that Meg thought she must have done something very rude.  She\\nblushed up to the little curls on her forehead, for he had never called\\nher Margaret before, and she was surprised to find how natural and\\nsweet it seemed to hear him say it.  Anxious to appear friendly and at\\nher ease, she put out her hand with a confiding gesture, and said\\ngratefully...\\n\\n\"How can I be afraid when you have been so kind to Father? I only wish\\nI could thank you for it.\"\\n\\n\"Shall I tell you how?\" asked Mr. Brooke, holding the small hand fast\\nin both his own, and looking down at Meg with so much love in the brown\\neyes that her heart began to flutter, and she both longed to run away\\nand to stop and listen.\\n\\n\"Oh no, please don\\'t, I\\'d rather not,\" she said, trying to withdraw her\\nhand, and looking frightened in spite of her denial.\\n\\n\"I won\\'t trouble you.  I only want to know if you care for me a little,\\nMeg.  I love you so much, dear,\" added Mr. Brooke tenderly.\\n\\nThis was the moment for the calm, proper speech, but Meg didn\\'t make\\nit.  She forgot every word of it, hung her head, and answered, \"I don\\'t\\nknow,\" so softly that John had to stoop down to catch the foolish\\nlittle reply.\\n\\nHe seemed to think it was worth the trouble, for he smiled to himself\\nas if quite satisfied, pressed the plump hand gratefully, and said in\\nhis most persuasive tone, \"Will you try and find out?  I want to know\\nso much, for I can\\'t go to work with any heart until I learn whether I\\nam to have my reward in the end or not.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m too young,\" faltered Meg, wondering why she was so fluttered, yet\\nrather enjoying it.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll wait, and in the meantime, you could be learning to like me.\\nWould it be a very hard lesson, dear?\"\\n\\n\"Not if I chose to learn it, but. . .\"\\n\\n\"Please choose to learn, Meg.  I love to teach, and this is easier than\\nGerman,\" broke in John, getting possession of the other hand, so that\\nshe had no way of hiding her face as he bent to look into it.\\n\\nHis tone was properly beseeching, but stealing a shy look at him, Meg\\nsaw that his eyes were merry as well as tender, and that he wore the\\nsatisfied smile of one who had no doubt of his success.  This nettled\\nher.  Annie Moffat\\'s foolish lessons in coquetry came into her mind,\\nand the love of power, which sleeps in the bosoms of the best of little\\nwomen, woke up all of a sudden and took possession of her.  She felt\\nexcited and strange, and not knowing what else to do, followed a\\ncapricious impulse, and, withdrawing her hands, said petulantly, \"I\\ndon\\'t choose.  Please go away and let me be!\"\\n\\nPoor Mr. Brooke looked as if his lovely castle in the air was tumbling\\nabout his ears, for he had never seen Meg in such a mood before, and it\\nrather bewildered him.\\n\\n\"Do you really mean that?\" he asked anxiously, following her as she\\nwalked away.\\n\\n\"Yes, I do.  I don\\'t want to be worried about such things. Father says\\nI needn\\'t, it\\'s too soon and I\\'d rather not.\"\\n\\n\"Mayn\\'t I hope you\\'ll change your mind by-and-by?  I\\'ll wait and say\\nnothing till you have had more time.  Don\\'t play with me, Meg.  I\\ndidn\\'t think that of you.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t think of me at all.  I\\'d rather you wouldn\\'t,\" said Meg, taking\\na naughty satisfaction in trying her lover\\'s patience and her own power.\\n\\nHe was grave and pale now, and looked decidedly more like the novel\\nheroes whom she admired, but he neither slapped his forehead nor\\ntramped about the room as they did.  He just stood looking at her so\\nwistfully, so tenderly, that she found her heart relenting in spite of\\nherself.  What would have happened next I cannot say, if Aunt March had\\nnot come hobbling in at this interesting minute.\\n\\nThe old lady couldn\\'t resist her longing to see her nephew, for she had\\nmet Laurie as she took her airing, and hearing of Mr. March\\'s arrival,\\ndrove straight out to see him.  The family were all busy in the back\\npart of the house, and she had made her way quietly in, hoping to\\nsurprise them.  She did surprise two of them so much that Meg started\\nas if she had seen a ghost, and Mr. Brooke vanished into the study.\\n\\n\"Bless me, what\\'s all this?\" cried the old lady with a rap of her cane\\nas she glanced from the pale young gentleman to the scarlet young lady.\\n\\n\"It\\'s Father\\'s friend.  I\\'m so surprised to see you!\" stammered Meg,\\nfeeling that she was in for a lecture now.\\n\\n\"That\\'s evident,\" returned Aunt March, sitting down.  \"But what is\\nFather\\'s friend saying to make you look like a peony? There\\'s mischief\\ngoing on, and I insist upon knowing what it is,\" with another rap.\\n\\n\"We were only talking.  Mr. Brooke came for his umbrella,\" began Meg,\\nwishing that Mr. Brooke and the umbrella were safely out of the house.\\n\\n\"Brooke?  That boy\\'s tutor?  Ah! I understand now.  I know all about\\nit.  Jo blundered into a wrong message in one of your Father\\'s letters,\\nand I made her tell me.  You haven\\'t gone and accepted him, child?\"\\ncried Aunt March, looking scandalized.\\n\\n\"Hush! He\\'ll hear.  Shan\\'t I call Mother?\" said Meg, much troubled.\\n\\n\"Not yet.  I\\'ve something to say to you, and I must free my mind at\\nonce.  Tell me, do you mean to marry this Cook?  If you do, not one\\npenny of my money ever goes to you.  Remember that, and be a sensible\\ngirl,\" said the old lady impressively.\\n\\nNow Aunt March possessed in perfection the art of rousing the spirit of\\nopposition in the gentlest people, and enjoyed doing it.  The best of\\nus have a spice of perversity in us, especially when we are young and\\nin love.  If Aunt March had begged Meg to accept John Brooke, she would\\nprobably have declared she couldn\\'t think of it, but as she was\\npreemptorily ordered not to like him, she immediately made up her mind\\nthat she would.  Inclination as well as perversity made the decision\\neasy, and being already much excited, Meg opposed the old lady with\\nunusual spirit.\\n\\n\"I shall marry whom I please, Aunt March, and you can leave your money\\nto anyone you like,\" she said, nodding her head with a resolute air.\\n\\n\"Highty-tighty!  Is that the way you take my advice, Miss? You\\'ll be\\nsorry for it by-and-by, when you\\'ve tried love in a cottage and found\\nit a failure.\"\\n\\n\"It can\\'t be a worse one than some people find in big houses,\" retorted\\nMeg.\\n\\nAunt March put on her glasses and took a look at the girl, for she did\\nnot know her in this new mood.  Meg hardly knew herself, she felt so\\nbrave and independent, so glad to defend John and assert her right to\\nlove him, if she liked.  Aunt March saw that she had begun wrong, and\\nafter a little pause, made a fresh start, saying as mildly as she\\ncould, \"Now, Meg, my dear, be reasonable and take my advice.  I mean it\\nkindly, and don\\'t want you to spoil your whole life by making a mistake\\nat the beginning.  You ought to marry well and help your family.  It\\'s\\nyour duty to make a rich match and it ought to be impressed upon you.\"\\n\\n\"Father and Mother don\\'t think so.  They like John though he is poor.\"\\n\\n\"Your parents, my dear, have no more worldly wisdom than a pair of\\nbabies.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad of it,\" cried Meg stoutly.\\n\\nAunt March took no notice, but went on with her lecture. \"This Rook is\\npoor and hasn\\'t got any rich relations, has he?\"\\n\\n\"No, but he has many warm friends.\"\\n\\n\"You can\\'t live on friends, try it and see how cool they\\'ll grow.  He\\nhasn\\'t any business, has he?\"\\n\\n\"Not yet.  Mr. Laurence is going to help him.\"\\n\\n\"That won\\'t last long.  James Laurence is a crotchety old fellow and\\nnot to be depended on.  So you intend to marry a man without money,\\nposition, or business, and go on working harder than you do now, when\\nyou might be comfortable all your days by minding me and doing better?\\nI thought you had more sense, Meg.\"\\n\\n\"I couldn\\'t do better if I waited half my life!  John is good and wise,\\nhe\\'s got heaps of talent, he\\'s willing to work and sure to get on, he\\'s\\nso energetic and brave.  Everyone likes and respects him, and I\\'m proud\\nto think he cares for me, though I\\'m so poor and young and silly,\" said\\nMeg, looking prettier than ever in her earnestness.\\n\\n\"He knows you have got rich relations, child.  That\\'s the secret of his\\nliking, I suspect.\"\\n\\n\"Aunt March, how dare you say such a thing?  John is above such\\nmeanness, and I won\\'t listen to you a minute if you talk so,\" cried Meg\\nindignantly, forgetting everything but the injustice of the old lady\\'s\\nsuspicions.  \"My John wouldn\\'t marry for money, any more than I would.\\nWe are willing to work and we mean to wait.  I\\'m not afraid of being\\npoor, for I\\'ve been happy so far, and I know I shall be with him\\nbecause he loves me, and I...\"\\n\\nMeg stopped there, remembering all of a sudden that she hadn\\'t made up\\nher mind, that she had told \\'her John\\' to go away, and that he might be\\noverhearing her inconsistent remarks.\\n\\nAunt March was very angry, for she had set her heart on having her\\npretty niece make a fine match, and something in the girl\\'s happy young\\nface made the lonely old woman feel both sad and sour.\\n\\n\"Well, I wash my hands of the whole affair!  You are a willful child,\\nand you\\'ve lost more than you know by this piece of folly. No, I won\\'t\\nstop.  I\\'m disappointed in you, and haven\\'t spirits to see your father\\nnow.  Don\\'t expect anything from me when you are married.  Your Mr.\\nBrooke\\'s friends must take care of you.  I\\'m done with you forever.\"\\n\\nAnd slamming the door in Meg\\'s face, Aunt March drove off in high\\ndudgeon.  She seemed to take all the girl\\'s courage with her, for when\\nleft alone, Meg stood for a moment, undecided whether to laugh or cry.\\nBefore she could make up her mind, she was taken possession of by Mr.\\nBrooke, who said all in one breath, \"I couldn\\'t help hearing, Meg.\\nThank you for defending me, and Aunt March for proving that you do care\\nfor me a little bit.\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t know how much till she abused you,\" began Meg.\\n\\n\"And I needn\\'t go away, but may stay and be happy, may I, dear?\"\\n\\nHere was another fine chance to make the crushing speech and the\\nstately exit, but Meg never thought of doing either, and disgraced\\nherself forever in Jo\\'s eyes by meekly whispering, \"Yes,  John,\" and\\nhiding her face on Mr. Brooke\\'s waistcoat.\\n\\nFifteen minutes after Aunt March\\'s departure, Jo came softly\\ndownstairs, paused an instant at the parlor door, and hearing no sound\\nwithin, nodded and smiled with a satisfied expression, saying to\\nherself, \"She has seen him away as we planned, and that affair is\\nsettled.  I\\'ll go and hear the fun, and have a good laugh over it.\"\\n\\nBut poor Jo never got her laugh, for she was transfixed upon the\\nthreshold by a spectacle which held her there, staring with her mouth\\nnearly as wide open as her eyes.  Going in to exult over a fallen enemy\\nand to praise a strong-minded sister for the banishment of an\\nobjectionable lover, it certainly was a shock to behold the aforesaid\\nenemy serenely sitting on the sofa, with the strongminded sister\\nenthroned upon his knee and wearing an expression of the most abject\\nsubmission.  Jo gave a sort of gasp, as if a cold shower bath had\\nsuddenly fallen upon her, for such an unexpected turning of the tables\\nactually took her breath away.  At the odd sound the lovers turned and\\nsaw her.  Meg jumped up, looking both proud and shy, but \\'that man\\', as\\nJo called him, actually laughed and said coolly, as he kissed the\\nastonished newcomer, \"Sister Jo, congratulate us!\"\\n\\nThat was adding insult to injury, it was altogether too much, and\\nmaking some wild demonstration with her hands, Jo vanished without a\\nword.  Rushing upstairs, she startled the invalids by exclaiming\\ntragically as she burst into the room, \"Oh, do somebody go down quick!\\nJohn Brooke is acting dreadfully, and Meg likes it!\"\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. March left the room with speed, and casting herself upon\\nthe bed, Jo cried and scolded tempestuously as she told the awful news\\nto Beth and Amy.  The little girls, however, considered it a most\\nagreeable and interesting event, and Jo got little comfort from them,\\nso she went up to her refuge in the garret, and confided her troubles\\nto the rats.\\n\\nNobody ever knew what went on in the parlor that afternoon, but a great\\ndeal of talking was done, and quiet Mr. Brooke astonished his friends\\nby the eloquence and spirit with which he pleaded his suit, told his\\nplans, and persuaded them to arrange everything just as he wanted it.\\n\\nThe tea bell rang before he had finished describing the paradise which\\nhe meant to earn for Meg, and he proudly took her in to supper, both\\nlooking so happy that Jo hadn\\'t the heart to be jealous or dismal. Amy\\nwas very much impressed by John\\'s devotion and Meg\\'s dignity, Beth\\nbeamed at them from a distance, while Mr. and Mrs. March surveyed the\\nyoung couple with such tender satisfaction that it was perfectly\\nevident Aunt March was right in calling them as \\'unworldly as a pair of\\nbabies\\'.  No one ate much, but everyone looked very happy, and the old\\nroom seemed to brighten up amazingly when the first romance of the\\nfamily began there.\\n\\n\"You can\\'t say nothing pleasant ever happens now, can you, Meg?\" said\\nAmy, trying to decide how she would group the lovers in a sketch she\\nwas planning to make.\\n\\n\"No, I\\'m sure I can\\'t.  How much has happened since I said that! It\\nseems a year ago,\" answered Meg, who was in a blissful dream lifted far\\nabove such common things as bread and butter.\\n\\n\"The joys come close upon the sorrows this time, and I rather think the\\nchanges have begun,\" said Mrs. March.  \"In most families there comes,\\nnow and then, a year full of events.  This has been such a one, but it\\nends well, after all.\"\\n\\n\"Hope the next will end better,\" muttered Jo, who found it very hard to\\nsee Meg absorbed in a stranger before her face, for Jo loved a few\\npersons very dearly and dreaded to have their affection lost or\\nlessened in any way.\\n\\n\"I hope the third year from this will end better.  I mean it shall, if\\nI live to work out my plans,\" said Mr. Brooke, smiling at Meg, as if\\neverything had become possible to him now.\\n\\n\"Doesn\\'t it seem very long to wait?\" asked Amy, who was in a hurry for\\nthe wedding.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got so much to learn before I shall be ready, it seems a short\\ntime to me,\" answered Meg, with a sweet gravity in her face never seen\\nthere before.\\n\\n\"You have only to wait, I am to do the work,\" said John beginning his\\nlabors by picking up Meg\\'s napkin, with an expression which caused Jo\\nto shake her head, and then say to herself with an air of relief as the\\nfront door banged, \"Here comes Laurie.  Now we shall have some sensible\\nconversation.\"\\n\\nBut Jo was mistaken, for Laurie came prancing in, overflowing with good\\nspirits, bearing a great bridal-looking bouquet for \\'Mrs. John Brooke\\',\\nand evidently laboring under the delusion that the whole affair had\\nbeen brought about by his excellent management.\\n\\n\"I knew Brooke would have it all his own way, he always does, for when\\nhe makes up his mind to accomplish anything, it\\'s done though the sky\\nfalls,\" said Laurie, when he had presented his offering and his\\ncongratulations.\\n\\n\"Much obliged for that recommendation.  I take it as a good omen for\\nthe future and invite you to my wedding on the spot,\" answered Mr.\\nBrooke, who felt at peace with all mankind, even his mischievous pupil.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll come if I\\'m at the ends of the earth, for the sight of Jo\\'s face\\nalone on that occasion would be worth a long journey. You don\\'t look\\nfestive, ma\\'am, what\\'s the matter?\" asked Laurie, following her into a\\ncorner of the parlor, whither all had adjourned to greet Mr. Laurence.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t approve of the match, but I\\'ve made up my mind to bear it, and\\nshall not say a word against it,\" said Jo solemnly.  \"You can\\'t know\\nhow hard it is for me to give up Meg,\" she continued with a little\\nquiver in her voice.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t give her up.  You only go halves,\" said Laurie consolingly.\\n\\n\"It can never be the same again.  I\\'ve lost my dearest friend,\" sighed\\nJo.\\n\\n\"You\\'ve got me, anyhow.  I\\'m not good for much, I know, but I\\'ll stand\\nby you, Jo, all the days of my life.  Upon my word I will!\" and Laurie\\nmeant what he said.\\n\\n\"I know you will, and I\\'m ever so much obliged.  You are always a great\\ncomfort to me, Teddy,\" returned Jo, gratefully shaking hands.\\n\\n\"Well, now, don\\'t be dismal, there\\'s a good fellow.  It\\'s all right you\\nsee.  Meg is happy, Brooke will fly round and get settled immediately,\\nGrandpa will attend to him, and it will be very jolly to see Meg in her\\nown little house.  We\\'ll have capital times after she is gone, for I\\nshall be through college before long, and then we\\'ll go abroad on some\\nnice trip or other.  Wouldn\\'t that console you?\"\\n\\n\"I rather think it would, but there\\'s no knowing what may happen in\\nthree years,\" said Jo thoughtfully.\\n\\n\"That\\'s true.  Don\\'t you wish you could take a look forward and see\\nwhere we shall all be then?  I do,\" returned Laurie.\\n\\n\"I think not, for I might see something sad, and everyone looks so\\nhappy now, I don\\'t believe they could be much improved.\" And Jo\\'s eyes\\nwent slowly round the room, brightening as they looked, for the\\nprospect was a pleasant one.\\n\\nFather and Mother sat together, quietly reliving the first chapter of\\nthe romance which for them began some twenty years ago. Amy was drawing\\nthe lovers, who sat apart in a beautiful world of their own, the light\\nof which touched their faces with a grace the little artist could not\\ncopy.  Beth lay on her sofa, talking cheerily with her old friend, who\\nheld her little hand as if he felt that it possessed the power to lead\\nhim along the peaceful way she walked. Jo lounged in her favorite low\\nseat, with the grave quiet look which best became her, and Laurie,\\nleaning on the back of her chair, his chin on a level with her curly\\nhead, smiled with his friendliest aspect, and nodded at her in the long\\nglass which reflected them both.\\n\\n\\nSo the curtain falls upon Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy.  Whether it ever\\nrises again, depends upon the reception given the first act of the\\ndomestic drama called _Little Women_.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLITTLE WOMEN PART 2\\n\\nIn order that we may start afresh and go to Meg\\'s wedding...\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'TWENTY-FOUR\\n\\nGOSSIP\\n\\nIn order that we may start afresh and go to Meg\\'s wedding with free\\nminds, it will be well to begin with a little gossip about the Marches.\\nAnd here let me premise that if any of the elders think there is too\\nmuch \\'lovering\\' in the story, as I fear they may (I\\'m not afraid the\\nyoung folks will make that objection), I can only say with Mrs. March,\\n\"What can you expect when I have four gay girls in the house, and a\\ndashing young neighbor over the way?\"\\n\\nThe three years that have passed have brought but few changes to the\\nquiet family.  The war is over, and Mr. March safely at home, busy with\\nhis books and the small parish which found in him a minister by nature\\nas by grace, a quiet, studious man, rich in the wisdom that is better\\nthan learning, the charity which calls all mankind \\'brother\\', the piety\\nthat blossoms into character, making it august and lovely.\\n\\nThese attributes, in spite of poverty and the strict integrity which\\nshut him out from the more worldly successes, attracted to him many\\nadmirable persons, as naturally as sweet herbs draw bees, and as\\nnaturally he gave them the honey into which fifty years of hard\\nexperience had distilled no bitter drop.  Earnest young men found the\\ngray-headed scholar as young at heart as they; thoughtful or troubled\\nwomen instinctively brought their doubts to him, sure of finding the\\ngentlest sympathy, the wisest counsel.  Sinners told their sins to the\\npure-hearted old man and were both rebuked and saved.  Gifted men found\\na companion in him.  Ambitious men caught glimpses of nobler ambitions\\nthan their own, and even worldlings confessed that his beliefs were\\nbeautiful and true, although \\'they wouldn\\'t pay\\'.\\n\\nTo outsiders the five energetic women seemed to rule the house, and so\\nthey did in many things, but the quiet scholar, sitting among his\\nbooks, was still the head of the family, the household conscience,\\nanchor, and comforter, for to him the busy, anxious women always turned\\nin troublous times, finding him, in the truest sense of those sacred\\nwords, husband and father.\\n\\nThe girls gave their hearts into their mother\\'s keeping, their souls\\ninto their father\\'s, and to both parents, who lived and labored so\\nfaithfully for them, they gave a love that grew with their growth and\\nbound them tenderly together by the sweetest tie which blesses life and\\noutlives death.\\n\\nMrs. March is as brisk and cheery, though rather grayer, than when we\\nsaw her last, and just now so absorbed in Meg\\'s affairs that the\\nhospitals and homes still full of wounded \\'boys\\' and soldiers\\' widows,\\ndecidedly miss the motherly missionary\\'s visits.\\n\\nJohn Brooke did his duty manfully for a year, got wounded, was sent\\nhome, and not allowed to return.  He received no stars or bars, but he\\ndeserved them, for he cheerfully risked all he had, and life and love\\nare very precious when both are in full bloom.  Perfectly resigned to\\nhis discharge, he devoted himself to getting well, preparing for\\nbusiness, and earning a home for Meg.  With the good sense and sturdy\\nindependence that characterized him, he refused Mr. Laurence\\'s more\\ngenerous offers, and accepted the place of bookkeeper, feeling better\\nsatisfied to begin with an honestly earned salary than by running any\\nrisks with borrowed money.\\n\\nMeg had spent the time in working as well as waiting, growing womanly\\nin character, wise in housewifely arts, and prettier than ever, for\\nlove is a great beautifier.  She had her girlish ambitions and hopes,\\nand felt some disappointment at the humble way in which the new life\\nmust begin.  Ned Moffat had just married Sallie Gardiner, and Meg\\ncouldn\\'t help contrasting their fine house and carriage, many gifts,\\nand splendid outfit with her own, and secretly wishing she could have\\nthe same.  But somehow envy and discontent soon vanished when she\\nthought of all the patient love and labor John had put into the little\\nhome awaiting her, and when they sat together in the twilight, talking\\nover their small plans, the future always grew so beautiful and bright\\nthat she forgot Sallie\\'s splendor and felt herself the richest,\\nhappiest girl in Christendom.\\n\\nJo never went back to Aunt March, for the old lady took such a fancy to\\nAmy that she bribed her with the offer of drawing lessons from one of\\nthe best teachers going, and for the sake of this advantage, Amy would\\nhave served a far harder mistress.  So she gave her mornings to duty,\\nher afternoons to pleasure, and prospered finely. Jo meantime devoted\\nherself to literature and Beth, who remained delicate long after the\\nfever was a thing of the past.  Not an invalid exactly, but never again\\nthe rosy, healthy creature she had been, yet always hopeful, happy, and\\nserene, and busy with the quiet duties she loved, everyone\\'s friend,\\nand an angel in the house, long before those who loved her most had\\nlearned to know it.\\n\\nAs long as _The Spread Eagle_ paid her a dollar a column for her\\n\\'rubbish\\', as she called it, Jo felt herself a woman of means, and spun\\nher little romances diligently.  But great plans fermented in her busy\\nbrain and ambitious mind, and the old tin kitchen in the garret held a\\nslowly increasing pile of blotted manuscript, which was one day to\\nplace the name of March upon the roll of fame.\\n\\nLaurie, having dutifully gone to college to please his grandfather, was\\nnow getting through it in the easiest possible manner to please\\nhimself.  A universal favorite, thanks to money, manners, much talent,\\nand the kindest heart that ever got its owner into scrapes by trying to\\nget other people out of them, he stood in great danger of being\\nspoiled, and probably would have been, like many another promising boy,\\nif he had not possessed a talisman against evil in the memory of the\\nkind old man who was bound up in his success, the motherly friend who\\nwatched over him as if he were her son, and last, but not least by any\\nmeans, the knowledge that four innocent girls loved, admired, and\\nbelieved in him with all their hearts.\\n\\nBeing only \\'a glorious human boy\\', of course he frolicked and flirted,\\ngrew dandified, aquatic, sentimental, or gymnastic, as college fashions\\nordained, hazed and was hazed, talked slang, and more than once came\\nperilously near suspension and expulsion.  But as high spirits and the\\nlove of fun were the causes of these pranks, he always managed to save\\nhimself by frank confession, honorable atonement, or the irresistible\\npower of persuasion which he possessed in perfection.  In fact, he\\nrather prided himself on his narrow escapes, and liked to thrill the\\ngirls with graphic accounts of his triumphs over wrathful tutors,\\ndignified professors, and vanquished enemies.  The \\'men of my class\\',\\nwere heroes in the eyes of the girls, who never wearied of the exploits\\nof \\'our fellows\\', and were frequently allowed to bask in the smiles of\\nthese great creatures, when Laurie brought them home with him.\\n\\nAmy especially enjoyed this high honor, and became quite a belle among\\nthem, for her ladyship early felt and learned to use the gift of\\nfascination with which she was endowed.  Meg was too much absorbed in\\nher private and particular John to care for any other lords of\\ncreation, and Beth too shy to do more than peep at them and wonder how\\nAmy dared to order them about so, but Jo felt quite in her own element,\\nand found it very difficult to refrain from imitating the gentlemanly\\nattitudes, phrases, and feats, which seemed more natural to her than\\nthe decorums prescribed for young ladies.  They all liked Jo immensely,\\nbut never fell in love with her, though very few escaped without paying\\nthe tribute of a sentimental sigh or two at Amy\\'s shrine.  And speaking\\nof sentiment brings us very naturally to the \\'Dovecote\\'.\\n\\nThat was the name of the little brown house Mr. Brooke had prepared for\\nMeg\\'s first home.  Laurie had christened it, saying it was highly\\nappropriate to the gentle lovers who \\'went on together like a pair of\\nturtledoves, with first a bill and then a coo\\'.  It was a tiny house,\\nwith a little garden behind and a lawn about as big as a pocket\\nhandkerchief in the front.  Here Meg meant to have a fountain,\\nshrubbery, and a profusion of lovely flowers, though just at present\\nthe fountain was represented by a weather-beaten urn, very like a\\ndilapidated slopbowl, the shrubbery consisted of several young larches,\\nundecided whether to live or die, and the profusion of flowers was\\nmerely hinted by regiments of sticks to show where seeds were planted.\\nBut inside, it was altogether charming, and the happy bride saw no\\nfault from garret to cellar.  To be sure, the hall was so narrow it was\\nfortunate that they had no piano, for one never could have been got in\\nwhole, the dining room was so small that six people were a tight fit,\\nand the kitchen stairs seemed built for the express purpose of\\nprecipitating both servants and china pell-mell into the coalbin.  But\\nonce get used to these slight blemishes and nothing could be more\\ncomplete, for good sense and good taste had presided over the\\nfurnishing, and the result was highly satisfactory.  There were no\\nmarble-topped tables, long mirrors, or lace curtains in the little\\nparlor, but simple furniture, plenty of books, a fine picture or two, a\\nstand of flowers in the bay window, and, scattered all about, the\\npretty gifts which came from friendly hands and were the fairer for the\\nloving messages they brought.\\n\\nI don\\'t think the Parian Psyche Laurie gave lost any of its beauty\\nbecause John put up the bracket it stood upon, that any upholsterer\\ncould have draped the plain muslin curtains more gracefully than Amy\\'s\\nartistic hand, or that any store-room was ever better provided with\\ngood wishes, merry words, and happy hopes than that in which Jo and her\\nmother put away Meg\\'s few boxes, barrels, and bundles, and I am morally\\ncertain that the spandy new kitchen never could have looked so cozy and\\nneat if Hannah had not arranged every pot and pan a dozen times over,\\nand laid the fire all ready for lighting the minute \\'Mis.  Brooke came\\nhome\\'.  I also doubt if any young matron ever began life with so rich a\\nsupply of dusters, holders, and piece bags, for Beth made enough to\\nlast till the silver wedding came round, and invented three different\\nkinds of dishcloths for the express service of the bridal china.\\n\\nPeople who hire all these things done for them never know what they\\nlose, for the homeliest tasks get beautified if loving hands do them,\\nand Meg found so many proofs of this that everything in her small nest,\\nfrom the kitchen roller to the silver vase on her parlor table, was\\neloquent of home love and tender forethought.\\n\\nWhat happy times they had planning together, what solemn shopping\\nexcursions, what funny mistakes they made, and what shouts of laughter\\narose over Laurie\\'s ridiculous bargains.  In his love of jokes, this\\nyoung gentleman, though nearly through college, was a much of a boy as\\never.  His last whim had been to bring with him on his weekly visits\\nsome new, useful, and ingenious article for the young housekeeper.  Now\\na bag of remarkable clothespins, next, a wonderful nutmeg grater which\\nfell to pieces at the first trial, a knife cleaner that spoiled all the\\nknives, or a sweeper that picked the nap neatly off the carpet and left\\nthe dirt, labor-saving soap that took the skin off one\\'s hands,\\ninfallible cements which stuck firmly to nothing but the fingers of the\\ndeluded buyer, and every kind of tinware, from a toy savings bank for\\nodd pennies, to a wonderful boiler which would wash articles in its own\\nsteam with every prospect of exploding in the process.\\n\\nIn vain Meg begged him to stop.  John laughed at him, and Jo called him\\n\\'Mr. Toodles\\'.  He was possessed with a mania for patronizing Yankee\\ningenuity, and seeing his friends fitly furnished forth. So each week\\nbeheld some fresh absurdity.\\n\\nEverything was done at last, even to Amy\\'s arranging different colored\\nsoaps to match the different colored rooms, and Beth\\'s setting the\\ntable for the first meal.\\n\\n\"Are you satisfied?  Does it seem like home, and do you feel as if you\\nshould be happy here?\" asked Mrs. March, as she and her daughter went\\nthrough the new kingdom arm in arm, for just then they seemed to cling\\ntogether more tenderly than ever.\\n\\n\"Yes, Mother, perfectly satisfied, thanks to you all, and so happy that\\nI can\\'t talk about it,\" with a look that was far better than words.\\n\\n\"If she only had a servant or two it would be all right,\" said Amy,\\ncoming out of the parlor, where she had been trying to decide whether\\nthe bronze Mercury looked best on the whatnot or the mantlepiece.\\n\\n\"Mother and I have talked that over, and I have made up my mind to try\\nher way first.  There will be so little to do that with Lotty to run my\\nerrands and help me here and there, I shall only have enough work to\\nkeep me from getting lazy or homesick,\" answered Meg tranquilly.\\n\\n\"Sallie Moffat has four,\" began Amy.\\n\\n\"If Meg had four, the house wouldn\\'t hold them, and master and missis\\nwould have to camp in the garden,\" broke in Jo, who, enveloped in a big\\nblue pinafore, was giving the last polish to the door handles.\\n\\n\"Sallie isn\\'t a poor man\\'s wife, and many maids are in keeping with her\\nfine establishment.  Meg and John begin humbly, but I have a feeling\\nthat there will be quite as much happiness in the little house as in\\nthe big one.  It\\'s a great mistake for young girls like Meg to leave\\nthemselves nothing to do but dress, give orders, and gossip.  When I\\nwas first married, I used to long for my new clothes to wear out or get\\ntorn, so that I might have the pleasure of mending them, for I got\\nheartily sick of doing fancywork and tending my pocket handkerchief.\"\\n\\n\"Why didn\\'t you go into the kitchen and make messes, as Sallie says she\\ndoes to amuse herself, though they never turn out well and the servants\\nlaugh at her,\" said Meg.\\n\\n\"I did after a while, not to \\'mess\\' but to learn of Hannah how things\\nshould be done, that my servants need not laugh at me.  It was play\\nthen, but there came a time when I was truly grateful that I not only\\npossessed the will but the power to cook wholesome food for my little\\ngirls, and help myself when I could no longer afford to hire help.  You\\nbegin at the other end, Meg, dear, but the lessons you learn now will\\nbe of use to you by-and-by when John is a richer man, for the mistress\\nof a house, however splendid, should know how work ought to be done, if\\nshe wishes to be well and honestly served.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Mother, I\\'m sure of that,\" said Meg, listening respectfully to\\nthe little lecture, for the best of women will hold forth upon the all\\nabsorbing subject of house keeping.  \"Do you know I like this room most\\nof all in my baby house,\" added Meg, a minute after, as they went\\nupstairs and she looked into her well-stored linen closet.\\n\\nBeth was there, laying the snowy piles smoothly on the shelves and\\nexulting over the goodly array.  All three laughed as Meg spoke, for\\nthat linen closet was a joke.  You see, having said that if Meg married\\n\\'that Brooke\\' she shouldn\\'t have a cent of her money, Aunt March was\\nrather in a quandary when time had appeased her wrath and made her\\nrepent her vow.  She never broke her word, and was much exercised in\\nher mind how to get round it, and at last devised a plan whereby she\\ncould satisfy herself.  Mrs. Carrol, Florence\\'s mamma, was ordered to\\nbuy, have made, and marked a generous supply of house and table linen,\\nand send it as her present, all of which was faithfully done, but the\\nsecret leaked out, and was greatly enjoyed by the family, for Aunt\\nMarch tried to look utterly unconscious, and insisted that she could\\ngive nothing but the old-fashioned pearls long promised to the first\\nbride.\\n\\n\"That\\'s a housewifely taste which I am glad to see.  I had a young\\nfriend who set up housekeeping with six sheets, but she had finger\\nbowls for company and that satisfied her,\" said Mrs. March, patting the\\ndamask tablecloths, with a truly feminine appreciation of their\\nfineness.\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t a single finger bowl, but this is a setout that will last me\\nall my days, Hannah says.\"  And Meg looked quite contented, as well she\\nmight.\\n\\nA tall, broad-shouldered young fellow, with a cropped head, a felt\\nbasin of a hat, and a flyaway coat, came tramping down the road at a\\ngreat pace, walked over the low fence without stopping to open the\\ngate, straight up to Mrs. March, with both hands out and a hearty...\\n\\n\"Here I am, Mother!  Yes, it\\'s all right.\"\\n\\nThe last words were in answer to the look the elder lady gave him, a\\nkindly questioning look which the handsome eyes met so frankly that the\\nlittle ceremony closed, as usual, with a motherly kiss.\\n\\n\"For Mrs. John Brooke, with the maker\\'s congratulations and\\ncompliments.  Bless you, Beth!  What a refreshing spectacle you are,\\nJo.  Amy, you are getting altogether too handsome for a single lady.\"\\n\\nAs Laurie spoke, he delivered a brown paper parcel to Meg, pulled\\nBeth\\'s hair ribbon, stared at Jo\\'s big pinafore, and fell into an\\nattitude of mock rapture before Amy, then shook hands all round, and\\neveryone began to talk.\\n\\n\"Where is John?\" asked Meg anxiously.\\n\\n\"Stopped to get the license for tomorrow, ma\\'am.\"\\n\\n\"Which side won the last match, Teddy?\" inquired Jo, who persisted in\\nfeeling an interest in manly sports despite her nineteen years.\\n\\n\"Ours, of course.  Wish you\\'d been there to see.\"\\n\\n\"How is the lovely Miss Randal?\" asked Amy with a significant smile.\\n\\n\"More cruel than ever.  Don\\'t you see how I\\'m pining away?\" and Laurie\\ngave his broad chest a sounding slap and heaved a melodramatic sigh.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the last joke?  Undo the bundle and see, Meg,\" said Beth, eying\\nthe knobby parcel with curiosity.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a useful thing to have in the house in case of fire or thieves,\"\\nobserved Laurie, as a watchman\\'s rattle appeared, amid the laughter of\\nthe girls.\\n\\n\"Any time when John is away and you get frightened, Mrs. Meg, just\\nswing that out of the front window, and it will rouse the neighborhood\\nin a jiffy.  Nice thing, isn\\'t it?\" and Laurie gave them a sample of\\nits powers that made them cover up their ears.\\n\\n\"There\\'s gratitude for you!  And speaking of gratitude reminds me to\\nmention that you may thank Hannah for saving your wedding cake from\\ndestruction.  I saw it going into your house as I came by, and if she\\nhadn\\'t defended it manfully I\\'d have had a pick at it, for it looked\\nlike a remarkably plummy one.\"\\n\\n\"I wonder if you will ever grow up, Laurie,\" said Meg in a matronly\\ntone.\\n\\n\"I\\'m doing my best, ma\\'am, but can\\'t get much higher, I\\'m afraid, as\\nsix feet is about all men can do in these degenerate days,\" responded\\nthe young gentleman, whose head was about level with the little\\nchandelier.\\n\\n\"I suppose it would be profanation to eat anything in this\\nspick-and-span bower, so as I\\'m tremendously hungry, I propose an\\nadjournment,\" he added presently.\\n\\n\"Mother and I are going to wait for John.  There are some last things\\nto settle,\" said Meg, bustling away.\\n\\n\"Beth and I are going over to Kitty Bryant\\'s to get more flowers for\\ntomorrow,\" added Amy, tying a picturesque hat over her picturesque\\ncurls, and enjoying the effect as much as anybody.\\n\\n\"Come, Jo, don\\'t desert a fellow.  I\\'m in such a state of exhaustion I\\ncan\\'t get home without help.  Don\\'t take off your apron, whatever you\\ndo, it\\'s peculiarly becoming,\" said Laurie, as Jo bestowed his especial\\naversion in her capacious pocket and offered her arm to support his\\nfeeble steps.\\n\\n\"Now, Teddy, I want to talk seriously to you about tomorrow,\" began Jo,\\nas they strolled away together.  \"You must promise to behave well, and\\nnot cut up any pranks, and spoil our plans.\"\\n\\n\"Not a prank.\"\\n\\n\"And don\\'t say funny things when we ought to be sober.\"\\n\\n\"I never do.  You are the one for that.\"\\n\\n\"And I implore you not to look at me during the ceremony.  I shall\\ncertainly laugh if you do.\"\\n\\n\"You won\\'t see me, you\\'ll be crying so hard that the thick fog round\\nyou will obscure the prospect.\"\\n\\n\"I never cry unless for some great affliction.\"\\n\\n\"Such as fellows going to college, hey?\" cut in Laurie, with suggestive\\nlaugh.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be a peacock.  I only moaned a trifle to keep the girls company.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly.  I say, Jo, how is Grandpa this week?  Pretty amiable?\"\\n\\n\"Very.  Why, have you got into a scrape and want to know how he\\'ll take\\nit?\" asked Jo rather sharply.\\n\\n\"Now, Jo, do you think I\\'d look your mother in the face and say \\'All\\nright\\', if it wasn\\'t?\" and Laurie stopped short, with an injured air.\\n\\n\"No, I don\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"Then don\\'t go and be suspicious.  I only want some money,\" said\\nLaurie, walking on again, appeased by her hearty tone.\\n\\n\"You spend a great deal, Teddy.\"\\n\\n\"Bless you, I don\\'t spend it, it spends itself somehow, and is gone\\nbefore I know it.\"\\n\\n\"You are so generous and kind-hearted that you let people borrow, and\\ncan\\'t say \\'No\\' to anyone.  We heard about Henshaw and all you did for\\nhim.  If you always spent money in that way, no one would blame you,\"\\nsaid Jo warmly.\\n\\n\"Oh, he made a mountain out of a molehill.  You wouldn\\'t have me let\\nthat fine fellow work himself to death just for want of a little help,\\nwhen he is worth a dozen of us lazy chaps, would you?\"\\n\\n\"Of course not, but I don\\'t see the use of your having seventeen\\nwaistcoats, endless neckties, and a new hat every time you come home. I\\nthought you\\'d got over the dandy period, but every now and then it\\nbreaks out in a new spot.  Just now it\\'s the fashion to be hideous, to\\nmake your head look like a scrubbing brush, wear a strait jacket,\\norange gloves, and clumping square-toed boots.  If it was cheap\\nugliness, I\\'d say nothing, but it costs as much as the other, and I\\ndon\\'t get any satisfaction out of it.\"\\n\\nLaurie threw back his head, and laughed so heartily at this attack,\\nthat the felt hat fell off, and Jo walked on it, which insult only\\nafforded him an opportunity for expatiating on the advantages of a\\nrough-and-ready costume, as he folded up the maltreated hat, and\\nstuffed it into his pocket.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t lecture any more, there\\'s a good soul!  I have enough all\\nthrough the week, and like to enjoy myself when I come home. I\\'ll get\\nmyself up regardless of expense tomorrow and be a satisfaction to my\\nfriends.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll leave you in peace if you\\'ll only let your hair grow. I\\'m not\\naristocratic, but I do object to being seen with a person who looks\\nlike a young prize fighter,\" observed Jo severely.\\n\\n\"This unassuming style promotes study, that\\'s why we adopt it,\"\\nreturned Laurie, who certainly could not be accused of vanity, having\\nvoluntarily sacrificed a handsome curly crop to the demand for\\nquarter-inch-long stubble.\\n\\n\"By the way, Jo, I think that little Parker is really getting desperate\\nabout Amy.  He talks of her constantly, writes poetry, and moons about\\nin a most suspicious manner.  He\\'d better nip his little passion in the\\nbud, hadn\\'t he?\" added Laurie, in a confidential, elder brotherly tone,\\nafter a minute\\'s silence.\\n\\n\"Of course he had.  We don\\'t want any more marrying in this family for\\nyears to come.  Mercy on us, what are the children thinking of?\" and Jo\\nlooked as much scandalized as if Amy and little Parker were not yet in\\ntheir teens.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a fast age, and I don\\'t know what we are coming to, ma\\'am. You\\nare a mere infant, but you\\'ll go next, Jo, and we\\'ll be left\\nlamenting,\" said Laurie, shaking his head over the degeneracy of the\\ntimes.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be alarmed.  I\\'m not one of the agreeable sort.  Nobody will\\nwant me, and it\\'s a mercy, for there should always be one old maid in a\\nfamily.\"\\n\\n\"You won\\'t give anyone a chance,\" said Laurie, with a sidelong glance\\nand a little more color than before in his sunburned face. \"You won\\'t\\nshow the soft side of your character, and if a fellow gets a peep at it\\nby accident and can\\'t help showing that he likes it, you treat him as\\nMrs. Gummidge did her sweetheart, throw cold water over him, and get so\\nthorny no one dares touch or look at you.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t like that sort of thing.  I\\'m too busy to be worried with\\nnonsense, and I think it\\'s dreadful to break up families so. Now don\\'t\\nsay any more about it.  Meg\\'s wedding has turned all our heads, and we\\ntalk of nothing but lovers and such absurdities.  I don\\'t wish to get\\ncross, so let\\'s change the subject;\"  and Jo looked quite ready to\\nfling cold water on the slightest provocation.\\n\\nWhatever his feelings might have been, Laurie found a vent for them in\\na long low whistle and the fearful prediction as they parted at the\\ngate, \"Mark my words, Jo, you\\'ll go next.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'TWENTY-FIVE\\n\\nTHE FIRST WEDDING\\n\\nThe June roses over the porch were awake bright and early on that\\nmorning, rejoicing with all their hearts in the cloudless sunshine,\\nlike friendly little neighbors, as they were.  Quite flushed with\\nexcitement were their ruddy faces, as they swung in the wind,\\nwhispering to one another what they had seen, for some peeped in at the\\ndining room windows where the feast was spread, some climbed up to nod\\nand smile at the sisters as they dressed the bride, others waved a\\nwelcome to those who came and went on various errands in garden, porch,\\nand hall, and all, from the rosiest full-blown flower to the palest\\nbaby bud, offered their tribute of beauty and fragrance to the gentle\\nmistress who had loved and tended them so long.\\n\\nMeg looked very like a rose herself, for all that was best and sweetest\\nin heart and soul seemed to bloom into her face that day, making it\\nfair and tender, with a charm more beautiful than beauty. Neither silk,\\nlace, nor orange flowers would she have.  \"I don\\'t want a fashionable\\nwedding, but only those about me whom I love, and to them I wish to\\nlook and be my familiar self.\"\\n\\nSo she made her wedding gown herself, sewing into it the tender hopes\\nand innocent romances of a girlish heart.  Her sisters braided up her\\npretty hair, and the only ornaments she wore were the lilies of the\\nvalley, which \\'her John\\' liked best of all the flowers that grew.\\n\\n\"You do look just like our own dear Meg, only so very sweet and lovely\\nthat I should hug you if it wouldn\\'t crumple your dress,\" cried Amy,\\nsurveying her with delight when all was done.\\n\\n\"Then I am satisfied.  But please hug and kiss me, everyone, and don\\'t\\nmind my dress.  I want a great many crumples of this sort put into it\\ntoday,\"  and Meg opened her arms to her sisters, who clung about her\\nwith April faces for a minute, feeling that the new love had not\\nchanged the old.\\n\\n\"Now I\\'m going to tie John\\'s cravat for him, and then to stay a few\\nminutes with Father quietly in the study,\"  and Meg ran down to perform\\nthese little ceremonies, and then to follow her mother wherever she\\nwent, conscious that in spite of the smiles on the motherly face, there\\nwas a secret sorrow hid in the motherly heart at the flight of the\\nfirst bird from the nest.\\n\\nAs the younger girls stand together, giving the last touches to their\\nsimple toilet, it may be a good time to tell of a few changes which\\nthree years have wrought in their appearance, for all are looking their\\nbest just now.\\n\\nJo\\'s angles are much softened, she has learned to carry herself with\\nease, if not grace.  The curly crop has lengthened into a thick coil,\\nmore becoming to the small head atop of the tall figure.  There is a\\nfresh color in her brown cheeks, a soft shine in her eyes, and only\\ngentle words fall from her sharp tongue today.\\n\\nBeth has grown slender, pale, and more quiet than ever.  The beautiful,\\nkind eyes are larger, and in them lies an expression that saddens one,\\nalthough it is not sad itself.  It is the shadow of pain which touches\\nthe young face with such pathetic patience, but Beth seldom complains\\nand always speaks hopefully of \\'being better soon\\'.\\n\\nAmy is with truth considered \\'the flower of the family\\', for at sixteen\\nshe has the air and bearing of a full-grown woman, not beautiful, but\\npossessed of that indescribable charm called grace. One saw it in the\\nlines of her figure, the make and motion of her hands, the flow of her\\ndress, the droop of her hair, unconscious yet harmonious, and as\\nattractive to many as beauty itself.  Amy\\'s nose still afflicted her,\\nfor it never would grow Grecian, so did her mouth, being too wide, and\\nhaving a decided chin.  These offending features gave character to her\\nwhole face, but she never could see it, and consoled herself with her\\nwonderfully fair complexion, keen blue eyes, and curls more golden and\\nabundant than ever.\\n\\nAll three wore suits of thin silver gray (their best gowns for the\\nsummer), with blush roses in hair and bosom, and all three looked just\\nwhat they were, fresh-faced, happy-hearted girls, pausing a moment in\\ntheir busy lives to read with wistful eyes the sweetest chapter in the\\nromance of womanhood.\\n\\nThere were to be no ceremonious performances, everything was to be as\\nnatural and homelike as possible, so when Aunt March arrived, she was\\nscandalized to see the bride come running to welcome and lead her in,\\nto find the bridegroom fastening up a garland that had fallen down, and\\nto catch a glimpse of the paternal minister marching upstairs with a\\ngrave countenance and a wine bottle under each arm.\\n\\n\"Upon my word, here\\'s a state of things!\" cried the old lady, taking\\nthe seat of honor prepared for her, and settling the folds of her\\nlavender moire with a great rustle.  \"You oughtn\\'t to be seen till the\\nlast minute, child.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not a show, Aunty, and no one is coming to stare at me, to\\ncriticize my dress, or count the cost of my luncheon.  I\\'m too happy to\\ncare what anyone says or thinks, and I\\'m going to have my little\\nwedding just as I like it.  John, dear, here\\'s your hammer.\"  And away\\nwent Meg to help \\'that man\\' in his highly improper employment.\\n\\nMr. Brooke didn\\'t even say, \"Thank you,\" but as he stooped for the\\nunromantic tool, he kissed his little bride behind the folding door,\\nwith a look that made Aunt March whisk out her pocket handkerchief with\\na sudden dew in her sharp old eyes.\\n\\nA crash, a cry, and a laugh from Laurie, accompanied by the indecorous\\nexclamation, \"Jupiter Ammon!  Jo\\'s upset the cake again!\" caused a\\nmomentary flurry, which was hardly over when a flock of cousins\\narrived, and \\'the party came in\\', as Beth used to say when a child.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t let that young giant come near me, he worries me worse than\\nmosquitoes,\" whispered the old lady to Amy, as the rooms filled and\\nLaurie\\'s black head towered above the rest.\\n\\n\"He has promised to be very good today, and he can be perfectly elegant\\nif he likes,\" returned Amy, and gliding away to warn Hercules to beware\\nof the dragon, which warning caused him to haunt the old lady with a\\ndevotion that nearly distracted her.\\n\\nThere was no bridal procession, but a sudden silence fell upon the room\\nas Mr. March and the young couple took their places under the green\\narch.  Mother and sisters gathered close, as if loath to give Meg up.\\nThe fatherly voice broke more than once, which only seemed to make the\\nservice more beautiful and solemn.  The bridegroom\\'s hand trembled\\nvisibly, and no one heard his replies.  But Meg looked straight up in\\nher husband\\'s eyes, and said, \"I will!\" with such tender trust in her\\nown face and voice that her mother\\'s heart rejoiced and Aunt March\\nsniffed audibly.\\n\\nJo did not cry, though she was very near it once, and was only saved\\nfrom a demonstration by the consciousness that Laurie was staring\\nfixedly at her, with a comical mixture of merriment and emotion in his\\nwicked black eyes.  Beth kept her face hidden on her mother\\'s shoulder,\\nbut Amy stood like a graceful statue, with a most becoming ray of\\nsunshine touching her white forehead and the flower in her hair.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t at all the thing, I\\'m afraid, but the minute she was fairly\\nmarried, Meg cried, \"The first kiss for Marmee!\" and turning, gave it\\nwith her heart on her lips.  During the next fifteen minutes she looked\\nmore like a rose than ever, for everyone availed themselves of their\\nprivileges to the fullest extent, from Mr. Laurence to old Hannah, who,\\nadorned with a headdress fearfully and wonderfully made, fell upon her\\nin the hall, crying with a sob and a chuckle, \"Bless you, deary, a\\nhundred times!  The cake ain\\'t hurt a mite, and everything looks\\nlovely.\"\\n\\nEverybody cleared up after that, and said something brilliant, or tried\\nto, which did just as well, for laughter is ready when hearts are\\nlight.  There was no display of gifts, for they were already in the\\nlittle house, nor was there an elaborate breakfast, but a plentiful\\nlunch of cake and fruit, dressed with flowers. Mr. Laurence and Aunt\\nMarch shrugged and smiled at one another when water, lemonade, and\\ncoffee were found to be to only sorts of nectar which the three Hebes\\ncarried round.  No one said anything, till Laurie, who insisted on\\nserving the bride, appeared before her, with a loaded salver in his\\nhand and a puzzled expression on his face.\\n\\n\"Has Jo smashed all the bottles by accident?\" he whispered, \"or am I\\nmerely laboring under a delusion that I saw some lying about loose this\\nmorning?\"\\n\\n\"No, your grandfather kindly offered us his best, and Aunt March\\nactually sent some, but Father put away a little for Beth, and\\ndispatched the rest to the Soldier\\'s Home.  You know he thinks that\\nwine should be used only in illness, and Mother says that neither she\\nnor her daughters will ever offer it to any young man under her roof.\"\\n\\nMeg spoke seriously and expected to see Laurie frown or laugh, but he\\ndid neither, for after a quick look at her, he said, in his impetuous\\nway, \"I like that!  For I\\'ve seen enough harm done to wish other women\\nwould think as you do.\"\\n\\n\"You are not made wise by experience, I hope?\" and there was an anxious\\naccent in Meg\\'s voice.\\n\\n\"No.  I give you my word for it.  Don\\'t think too well of me, either,\\nthis is not one of my temptations.  Being brought up where wine is as\\ncommon as water and almost as harmless, I don\\'t care for it, but when a\\npretty girl offers it, one doesn\\'t like to refuse, you see.\"\\n\\n\"But you will, for the sake of others, if not for your own. Come,\\nLaurie, promise, and give me one more reason to call this the happiest\\nday of my life.\"\\n\\nA demand so sudden and so serious made the young man hesitate a moment,\\nfor ridicule is often harder to bear than self-denial. Meg knew that if\\nhe gave the promise he would keep it at all costs, and feeling her\\npower, used it as a woman may for her friend\\'s good. She did not speak,\\nbut she looked up at him with a face made very eloquent by happiness,\\nand a smile which said, \"No one can refuse me anything today.\"\\n\\nLaurie certainly could not, and with an answering smile, he gave her\\nhis hand, saying heartily, \"I promise, Mrs. Brooke!\"\\n\\n\"I thank you, very, very much.\"\\n\\n\"And I drink \\'long life to your resolution\\', Teddy,\" cried Jo,\\nbaptizing him with a splash of lemonade, as she waved her glass and\\nbeamed approvingly upon him.\\n\\nSo the toast was drunk, the pledge made and loyally kept in spite of\\nmany temptations, for with instinctive wisdom, the girls seized a happy\\nmoment to do their friend a service, for which he thanked them all his\\nlife.\\n\\nAfter lunch, people strolled about, by twos and threes, through the\\nhouse and garden, enjoying the sunshine without and within.  Meg and\\nJohn happened to be standing together in the middle of the grass plot,\\nwhen Laurie was seized with an inspiration which put the finishing\\ntouch to this unfashionable wedding.\\n\\n\"All the married people take hands and dance round the new-made husband\\nand wife, as the Germans do, while we bachelors and spinsters prance in\\ncouples outside!\" cried Laurie, promenading down the path with Amy,\\nwith such infectious spirit and skill that everyone else followed their\\nexample without a murmur.  Mr. and Mrs. March, Aunt and Uncle Carrol\\nbegan it, others rapidly joined in, even Sallie Moffat, after a\\nmoment\\'s hesitation, threw her train over her arm and whisked Ned into\\nthe ring.  But the crowning joke was Mr. Laurence and Aunt March, for\\nwhen the stately old gentleman chasseed solemnly up to the old lady,\\nshe just tucked her cane under her arm, and hopped briskly away to join\\nhands with the rest and dance about the bridal pair, while the young\\nfolks pervaded the garden like butterflies on a midsummer day.\\n\\nWant of breath brought the impromptu ball to a close, and then people\\nbegan to go.\\n\\n\"I wish you well, my dear, I heartily wish you well, but I think you\\'ll\\nbe sorry for it,\" said Aunt March to Meg, adding to the bridegroom, as\\nhe led her to the carriage, \"You\\'ve got a treasure, young man, see that\\nyou deserve it.\"\\n\\n\"That is the prettiest wedding I\\'ve been to for an age, Ned, and I\\ndon\\'t see why, for there wasn\\'t a bit of style about it,\" observed Mrs.\\nMoffat to her husband, as they drove away.\\n\\n\"Laurie, my lad, if you ever want to indulge in this sort of thing, get\\none of those little girls to help you, and I shall be perfectly\\nsatisfied,\" said Mr. Laurence, settling himself in his easy chair to\\nrest after the excitement of the morning.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll do my best to gratify you, Sir,\" was Laurie\\'s unusually dutiful\\nreply, as he carefully unpinned the posy Jo had put in his buttonhole.\\n\\nThe little house was not far away, and the only bridal journey Meg had\\nwas the quiet walk with John from the old home to the new. When she\\ncame down, looking like a pretty Quakeress in her dove-colored suit and\\nstraw bonnet tied with white, they all gathered about her to say\\n\\'good-by\\', as tenderly as if she had been going to make the grand tour.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t feel that I am separated from you, Marmee dear, or that I love\\nyou any the less for loving John so much,\" she said, clinging to her\\nmother, with full eyes for a moment.  \"I shall come every day, Father,\\nand expect to keep my old place in all your hearts, though I am\\nmarried.  Beth is going to be with me a great deal, and the other girls\\nwill drop in now and then to laugh at my housekeeping struggles. Thank\\nyou all for my happy wedding day.  Good-by, good-by!\"\\n\\nThey stood watching her, with faces full of love and hope and tender\\npride as she walked away, leaning on her husband\\'s arm, with her hands\\nfull of flowers and the June sunshine brightening her happy face--and\\nso Meg\\'s married life began.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'TWENTY-SIX\\n\\nARTISTIC ATTEMPTS\\n\\nIt takes people a long time to learn the difference between talent and\\ngenius, especially ambitious young men and women.  Amy was learning\\nthis distinction through much tribulation, for mistaking enthusiasm for\\ninspiration, she attempted every branch of art with youthful audacity.\\nFor a long time there was a lull in the \\'mud-pie\\' business, and she\\ndevoted herself to the finest pen-and-ink drawing, in which she showed\\nsuch taste and skill that her graceful handiwork proved both pleasant\\nand profitable.  But over-strained eyes caused pen and ink to be laid\\naside for a bold attempt at poker-sketching. While this attack lasted,\\nthe family lived in constant fear of a conflagration, for the odor of\\nburning wood pervaded the house at all hours, smoke issued from attic\\nand shed with alarming frequency, red-hot pokers lay about\\npromiscuously, and Hannah never went to bed without a pail of water and\\nthe dinner bell at her door in case of fire.  Raphael\\'s face was found\\nboldly executed on the underside of the moulding board, and Bacchus on\\nthe head of a beer barrel.  A chanting cherub adorned the cover of the\\nsugar bucket, and attempts to portray Romeo and Juliet supplied\\nkindling for some time.\\n\\nFrom fire to oil was a natural transition for burned fingers, and Amy\\nfell to painting with undiminished ardor.  An artist friend fitted her\\nout with his castoff palettes, brushes, and colors, and she daubed\\naway, producing pastoral and marine views such as were never seen on\\nland or sea.  Her monstrosities in the way of cattle would have taken\\nprizes at an agricultural fair, and the perilous pitching of her\\nvessels would have produced seasickness in the most nautical observer,\\nif the utter disregard to all known rules of shipbuilding and rigging\\nhad not convulsed him with laughter at the first glance.  Swarthy boys\\nand dark-eyed Madonnas, staring at you from one corner of the studio,\\nsuggested Murillo; oily brown shadows of faces with a lurid streak in\\nthe wrong place, meant Rembrandt; buxom ladies and dropiscal infants,\\nRubens; and Turner appeared in tempests of blue thunder, orange\\nlightning, brown rain, and purple clouds, with a tomato-colored splash\\nin the middle, which might be the sun or a bouy, a sailor\\'s shirt or a\\nking\\'s robe, as the spectator pleased.\\n\\nCharcoal portraits came next, and the entire family hung in a row,\\nlooking as wild and crocky as if just evoked from a coalbin. Softened\\ninto crayon sketches, they did better, for the likenesses were good,\\nand Amy\\'s hair, Jo\\'s nose, Meg\\'s mouth, and Laurie\\'s eyes were\\npronounced \\'wonderfully fine\\'.  A return to clay and plaster followed,\\nand ghostly casts of her acquaintances haunted corners of the house, or\\ntumbled off closet shelves onto people\\'s heads.  Children were enticed\\nin as models, till their incoherent accounts of her mysterious doings\\ncaused Miss Amy to be regarded in the light of a young ogress.  Her\\nefforts in this line, however, were brought to an abrupt close by an\\nuntoward accident, which quenched her ardor.  Other models failing her\\nfor a time, she undertook to cast her own pretty foot, and the family\\nwere one day alarmed by an unearthly bumping and screaming and running\\nto the rescue, found the young enthusiast hopping wildly about the shed\\nwith her foot held fast in a pan full of plaster, which had hardened\\nwith unexpected rapidity.  With much difficulty and some danger she was\\ndug out, for Jo was so overcome with laughter while she excavated that\\nher knife went too far, cut the poor foot, and left a lasting memorial\\nof one artistic attempt, at least.\\n\\nAfter this Amy subsided, till a mania for sketching from nature set her\\nto haunting river, field, and wood, for picturesque studies, and\\nsighing for ruins to copy.  She caught endless colds sitting on damp\\ngrass to book \\'a delicious bit\\', composed of a stone, a stump, one\\nmushroom, and a broken mullein stalk, or \\'a heavenly mass of clouds\\',\\nthat looked like a choice display of featherbeds when done. She\\nsacrificed her complexion floating on the river in the midsummer sun to\\nstudy light and shade, and got a wrinkle over her nose trying after\\n\\'points of sight\\', or whatever the squint-and-string performance is\\ncalled.\\n\\nIf \\'genius is eternal patience\\', as Michelangelo affirms, Amy had some\\nclaim to the divine attribute, for she persevered in spite of all\\nobstacles, failures, and discouragements, firmly believing that in time\\nshe should do something worthy to be called \\'high art\\'.\\n\\nShe was learning, doing, and enjoying other things, meanwhile, for she\\nhad resolved to be an attractive and accomplished woman, even if she\\nnever became a great artist.  Here she succeeded better, for she was\\none of those happily created beings who please without effort, make\\nfriends everywhere, and take life so gracefully and easily that less\\nfortunate souls are tempted to believe that such are born under a lucky\\nstar.  Everybody liked her, for among her good gifts was tact.  She had\\nan instinctive sense of what was pleasing and proper, always said the\\nright thing to the right person, did just what suited the time and\\nplace, and was so self-possessed that her sisters used to say, \"If Amy\\nwent to court without any rehearsal beforehand, she\\'d know exactly what\\nto do.\"\\n\\nOne of her weaknesses was a desire to move in \\'our best society\\',\\nwithout being quite sure what the best really was.  Money, position,\\nfashionable accomplishments, and elegant manners were most desirable\\nthings in her eyes, and she liked to associate with those who possessed\\nthem, often mistaking the false for the true, and admiring what was not\\nadmirable.  Never forgetting that by birth she was a gentlewoman, she\\ncultivated her aristocratic tastes and feelings, so that when the\\nopportunity came she might be ready to take the place from which\\npoverty now excluded her.\\n\\n\"My lady,\" as her friends called her, sincerely desired to be a genuine\\nlady, and was so at heart, but had yet to learn that money cannot buy\\nrefinement of nature, that rank does not always confer nobility, and\\nthat true breeding makes itself felt in spite of external drawbacks.\\n\\n\"I want to ask a favor of you, Mamma,\" Amy said, coming in with an\\nimportant air one day.\\n\\n\"Well, little girl, what is it?\" replied her mother, in whose eyes the\\nstately young lady still remained \\'the baby\\'.\\n\\n\"Our drawing class breaks up next week, and before the girls separate\\nfor the summer, I want to ask them out here for a day.  They are wild\\nto see the river, sketch the broken bridge, and copy some of the things\\nthey admire in my book.  They have been very kind to me in many ways,\\nand I am grateful, for they are all rich and I know I am poor, yet they\\nnever made any difference.\"\\n\\n\"Why should they?\" and Mrs. March put the question with what the girls\\ncalled her \\'Maria Theresa air\\'.\\n\\n\"You know as well as I that it does make a difference with nearly\\neveryone, so don\\'t ruffle up like a dear, motherly hen, when your\\nchickens get pecked by smarter birds.  The ugly duckling turned out a\\nswan, you know.\"  and Amy smiled without bitterness, for she possessed\\na happy temper and hopeful spirit.\\n\\nMrs. March laughed, and smoothed down her maternal pride as she asked,\\n\"Well, my swan, what is your plan?\"\\n\\n\"I should like to ask the girls out to lunch next week, to take them\\nfor a drive to the places they want to see, a row on the river,\\nperhaps, and make a little artistic fete for them.\"\\n\\n\"That looks feasible.  What do you want for lunch?  Cake, sandwiches,\\nfruit, and coffee will be all that is necessary, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, dear, no!  We must have cold tongue and chicken, French chocolate\\nand ice cream, besides.  The girls are used to such things, and I want\\nmy lunch to be proper and elegant, though I do work for my living.\"\\n\\n\"How many young ladies are there?\" asked her mother, beginning to look\\nsober.\\n\\n\"Twelve or fourteen in the class, but I dare say they won\\'t all come.\"\\n\\n\"Bless me, child, you will have to charter an omnibus to carry them\\nabout.\"\\n\\n\"Why, Mother, how can you think of such a thing?  Not more than six or\\neight will probably come, so I shall hire a beach wagon and borrow Mr.\\nLaurence\\'s cherry-bounce.\" (Hannah\\'s pronunciation of char-a-banc.)\\n\\n\"All of this will be expensive, Amy.\"\\n\\n\"Not very.  I\\'ve calculated the cost, and I\\'ll pay for it myself.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you think, dear, that as these girls are used to such things,\\nand the best we can do will be nothing new, that some simpler plan\\nwould be pleasanter to them, as a change if nothing more, and much\\nbetter for us than buying or borrowing what we don\\'t need, and\\nattempting a style not in keeping with our circumstances?\"\\n\\n\"If I can\\'t have it as I like, I don\\'t care to have it at all. I know\\nthat I can carry it out perfectly well, if you and the girls will help\\na little, and I don\\'t see why I can\\'t if I\\'m willing to pay for it,\"\\nsaid Amy, with the decision which opposition was apt to change into\\nobstinacy.\\n\\nMrs. March knew that experience was an excellent teacher, and when it\\nwas possible she left her children to learn alone the lessons which she\\nwould gladly have made easier, if they had not objected to taking\\nadvice as much as they did salts and senna.\\n\\n\"Very well, Amy, if your heart is set upon it, and you see your way\\nthrough without too great an outlay of money, time, and temper, I\\'ll\\nsay no more.  Talk it over with the girls, and whichever way you\\ndecide, I\\'ll do my best to help you.\"\\n\\n\"Thanks, Mother, you are always so kind.\" and away went Amy to lay her\\nplan before her sisters.\\n\\nMeg agreed at once, and promised her aid, gladly offering anything she\\npossessed, from her little house itself to her very best saltspoons.\\nBut Jo frowned upon the whole project and would have nothing to do with\\nit at first.\\n\\n\"Why in the world should you spend your money, worry your family, and\\nturn the house upside down for a parcel of girls who don\\'t care a\\nsixpence for you?  I thought you had too much pride and sense to\\ntruckle to any mortal woman just because she wears French boots and\\nrides in a coupe,\" said Jo, who, being called from the tragic climax of\\nher novel, was not in the best mood for social enterprises.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t truckle, and I hate being patronized as much as you do!\"\\nreturned Amy indignantly, for the two still jangled when such questions\\narose. \"The girls do care for me, and I for them, and there\\'s a great\\ndeal of kindness and sense and talent among them, in spite of what you\\ncall fashionable nonsense.  You don\\'t care to make people like you, to\\ngo into good society, and cultivate your manners and tastes.  I do, and\\nI mean to make the most of every chance that comes.  You can go through\\nthe world with your elbows out and your nose in the air, and call it\\nindependence, if you like.  That\\'s not my way.\"\\n\\nWhen Amy had whetted her tongue and freed her mind she usually got the\\nbest of it, for she seldom failed to have common sense on her side,\\nwhile Jo carried her love of liberty and hate of conventionalities to\\nsuch an unlimited extent that she naturally found herself worsted in an\\nargument.  Amy\\'s definition of Jo\\'s idea of independence was such a\\ngood hit that both burst out laughing, and the discussion took a more\\namiable turn.  Much against her will, Jo at length consented to\\nsacrifice a day to Mrs. Grundy, and help her sister through what she\\nregarded as \\'a nonsensical business\\'.\\n\\nThe invitations were sent, nearly all accepted, and the following\\nMonday was set apart for the grand event.  Hannah was out of humor\\nbecause her week\\'s work was deranged, and prophesied that \"ef the\\nwashin\\' and ironin\\' warn\\'t done reg\\'lar, nothin\\' would go well\\nanywheres\".  This hitch in the mainspring of the domestic machinery had\\na bad effect upon the whole concern, but Amy\\'s motto was \\'Nil\\ndesperandum\\', and having made up her mind what to do, she proceeded to\\ndo it in spite of all obstacles.  To begin with, Hannah\\'s cooking\\ndidn\\'t turn out well.  The chicken was tough, the tongue too salty, and\\nthe chocolate wouldn\\'t froth properly.  Then the cake and ice cost more\\nthan Amy expected, so did the wagon, and various other expenses, which\\nseemed trifling at the outset, counted up rather alarmingly afterward.\\nBeth got a cold and took to her bed.  Meg had an unusual number of\\ncallers to keep her at home, and Jo was in such a divided state of mind\\nthat her breakages, accidents, and mistakes were uncommonly numerous,\\nserious, and trying.\\n\\nIf it was not fair on Monday, the young ladies were to come on Tuesday,\\nan arrangement which aggravated Jo and Hannah to the last degree.  On\\nMonday morning the weather was in that undecided state which is more\\nexasperating than a steady pour.  It drizzled a little, shone a little,\\nblew a little, and didn\\'t make up its mind till it was too late for\\nanyone else to make up theirs.  Amy was up at dawn, hustling people out\\nof their beds and through their breakfasts, that the house might be got\\nin order.  The parlor struck her as looking uncommonly shabby, but\\nwithout stopping to sigh for what she had not, she skillfully made the\\nbest of what she had, arranging chairs over the worn places in the\\ncarpet, covering stains on the walls with homemade statuary, which gave\\nan artistic air to the room, as did the lovely vases of flowers Jo\\nscattered about.\\n\\nThe lunch looked charming, and as she surveyed it, she sincerely hoped\\nit would taste well, and that the borrowed glass, china, and silver\\nwould get safely home again.  The carriages were promised, Meg and\\nMother were all ready to do the honors, Beth was able to help Hannah\\nbehind the scenes, Jo had engaged to be as lively and amiable as an\\nabsent mind, and aching head, and a very decided disapproval of\\neverybody and everything would allow, and as she wearily dressed, Amy\\ncheered herself with anticipations of the happy moment when, lunch\\nsafely over, she should drive away with her friends for an afternoon of\\nartistic delights, for the \\'cherry bounce\\' and the broken bridge were\\nher strong points.\\n\\nThen came the hours of suspense, during which she vibrated from parlor\\nto porch, while public opinion varied like the weathercock.  A smart\\nshower at eleven had evidently quenched the enthusiasm of the young\\nladies who were to arrive at twelve, for nobody came, and at two the\\nexhausted family sat down in a blaze of sunshine to consume the\\nperishable portions of the feast, that nothing might be lost.\\n\\n\"No doubt about the weather today, they will certainly come, so we must\\nfly round and be ready for them,\" said Amy, as the sun woke her next\\nmorning.  She spoke briskly, but in her secret soul she wished she had\\nsaid nothing about Tuesday, for her interest like her cake was getting\\na little stale.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t get any lobsters, so you will have to do without salad today,\"\\nsaid Mr. March, coming in half an hour later, with an expression of\\nplacid despair.\\n\\n\"Use the chicken then, the toughness won\\'t matter in a salad,\" advised\\nhis wife.\\n\\n\"Hannah left it on the kitchen table a minute, and the kittens got at\\nit.  I\\'m very sorry, Amy,\" added Beth, who was still a patroness of\\ncats.\\n\\n\"Then I must have a lobster, for tongue alone won\\'t do,\" said Amy\\ndecidedly.\\n\\n\"Shall I rush into town and demand one?\" asked Jo, with the magnanimity\\nof a martyr.\\n\\n\"You\\'d come bringing it home under your arm without any paper, just to\\ntry me.  I\\'ll go myself,\" answered Amy, whose temper was beginning to\\nfail.\\n\\nShrouded in a thick veil and armed with a genteel traveling basket, she\\ndeparted, feeling that a cool drive would soothe her ruffled spirit and\\nfit her for the labors of the day.  After some delay, the object of her\\ndesire was procured, likewise a bottle of dressing to prevent further\\nloss of time at home, and off she drove again, well pleased with her\\nown forethought.\\n\\nAs the omnibus contained only one other passenger, a sleepy old lady,\\nAmy pocketed her veil and beguiled the tedium of the way by trying to\\nfind out where all her money had gone to.  So busy was she with her\\ncard full of refractory figures that she did not observe a newcomer,\\nwho entered without stopping the vehicle, till a masculine voice said,\\n\"Good morning, Miss March,\" and, looking up, she beheld one of Laurie\\'s\\nmost elegant college friends.  Fervently hoping that he would get out\\nbefore she did, Amy utterly ignored the basket at her feet, and\\ncongratulating herself that she had on her new traveling dress,\\nreturned the young man\\'s greeting with her usual suavity and spirit.\\n\\nThey got on excellently, for Amy\\'s chief care was soon set at rest by\\nlearning that the gentleman would leave first, and she was chatting\\naway in a peculiarly lofty strain, when the old lady got out. In\\nstumbling to the door, she upset the basket, and--oh horror!--the\\nlobster, in all its vulgar size and brilliancy, was revealed to the\\nhighborn eyes of a Tudor!\\n\\n\"By Jove, she\\'s forgotten her dinner!\" cried the unconscious youth,\\npoking the scarlet monster into its place with his cane, and preparing\\nto hand out the basket after the old lady.\\n\\n\"Please don\\'t--it\\'s--it\\'s mine,\" murmured Amy, with a face nearly as\\nred as her fish.\\n\\n\"Oh, really, I beg pardon.  It\\'s an uncommonly fine one, isn\\'t it?\"\\nsaid Tudor, with great presence of mind, and an air of sober interest\\nthat did credit to his breeding.\\n\\nAmy recovered herself in a breath, set her basket boldly on the seat,\\nand said, laughing, \"Don\\'t you wish you were to have some of the salad\\nhe\\'s going to make, and to see the charming young ladies who are to eat\\nit?\"\\n\\nNow that was tact, for two of the ruling foibles of the masculine mind\\nwere touched.  The lobster was instantly surrounded by a halo of\\npleasing reminiscences, and curiosity about \\'the charming young ladies\\'\\ndiverted his mind from the comical mishap.\\n\\n\"I suppose he\\'ll laugh and joke over it with Laurie, but I shan\\'t see\\nthem, that\\'s a comfort,\" thought Amy, as Tudor bowed and departed.\\n\\nShe did not mention this meeting at home (though she discovered that,\\nthanks to the upset, her new dress was much damaged by the rivulets of\\ndressing that meandered down the skirt), but went through with the\\npreparations which now seemed more irksome than before, and at twelve\\no\\'clock all was ready again.  Feeling that the neighbors were\\ninterested in her movements, she wished to efface the memory of\\nyesterday\\'s failure by a grand success today, so she ordered the\\n\\'cherry bounce\\', and drove away in state to meet and escort her guests\\nto the banquet.\\n\\n\"There\\'s the rumble, they\\'re coming!  I\\'ll go onto the porch and meet\\nthem.  It looks hospitable, and I want the poor child to have a good\\ntime after all her trouble,\" said Mrs. March, suiting the action to the\\nword.  But after one glance, she retired, with an indescribable\\nexpression, for looking quite lost in the big carriage, sat Amy and one\\nyoung lady.\\n\\n\"Run, Beth, and help Hannah clear half the things off the table. It\\nwill be too absurd to put a luncheon for twelve before a single girl,\"\\ncried Jo, hurrying away to the lower regions, too excited to stop even\\nfor a laugh.\\n\\nIn came Amy, quite calm and delightfully cordial to the one guest who\\nhad kept her promise.  The rest of the family, being of a dramatic\\nturn, played their parts equally well, and Miss Eliott found them a\\nmost hilarious set, for it was impossible to control entirely the\\nmerriment which possessed them.  The remodeled lunch being gaily\\npartaken of, the studio and garden visited, and art discussed with\\nenthusiasm, Amy ordered a buggy (alas for the elegant cherry-bounce),\\nand drove her friend quietly about the neighborhood till sunset, when\\n\\'the party went out\\'.\\n\\nAs she came walking in, looking very tired but as composed as ever, she\\nobserved that every vestige of the unfortunate fete had disappeared,\\nexcept a suspicious pucker about the corners of Jo\\'s mouth.\\n\\n\"You\\'ve had a loverly afternoon for your drive, dear,\" said her mother,\\nas respectfully as if the whole twelve had come.\\n\\n\"Miss Eliott is a very sweet girl, and seemed to enjoy herself, I\\nthought,\" observed Beth, with unusual warmth.\\n\\n\"Could you spare me some of your cake?  I really need some, I have so\\nmuch company, and I can\\'t make such delicious stuff as yours,\" asked\\nMeg soberly.\\n\\n\"Take it all.  I\\'m the only one here who likes sweet things, and it\\nwill mold before I can dispose of it,\" answered Amy, thinking with a\\nsigh of the generous store she had laid in for such an end as this.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a pity Laurie isn\\'t here to help us,\" began Jo, as they sat down\\nto ice cream and salad for the second time in two days.\\n\\nA warning look from her mother checked any further remarks, and the\\nwhole family ate in heroic silence, till Mr. March mildly observed,\\n\"salad was one of the favorite dishes of the ancients, and Evelyn...\"\\nHere a general explosion of laughter cut short the \\'history of salads\\',\\nto the great surprise of the learned gentleman.\\n\\n\"Bundle everything into a basket and send it to the Hummels.  Germans\\nlike messes.  I\\'m sick of the sight of this, and there\\'s no reason you\\nshould all die of a surfeit because I\\'ve been a fool,\" cried Amy,\\nwiping her eyes.\\n\\n\"I thought I should have died when I saw you two girls rattling about\\nin the what-you-call-it, like two little kernels in a very big\\nnutshell, and Mother waiting in state to receive the throng,\" sighed\\nJo, quite spent with laughter.\\n\\n\"I\\'m very sorry you were disappointed, dear, but we all did our best to\\nsatisfy you,\" said Mrs. March, in a tone full of motherly regret.\\n\\n\"I am satisfied.  I\\'ve done what I undertook, and it\\'s not my fault\\nthat it failed.  I comfort myself with that,\" said Amy with a little\\nquiver in her voice.  \"I thank you all very much for helping me, and\\nI\\'ll thank you still more if you won\\'t allude to it for a month, at\\nleast.\"\\n\\nNo one did for several months, but the word \\'fete\\' always produced a\\ngeneral smile, and Laurie\\'s birthday gift to Amy was a tiny coral\\nlobster in the shape of a charm for her watch guard.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'TWENTY-SEVEN\\n\\nLITERARY LESSONS\\n\\nFortune suddenly smiled upon Jo, and dropped a good luck penny in her\\npath.  Not a golden penny, exactly, but I doubt if half a million would\\nhave given more real happiness then did the little sum that came to her\\nin this wise.\\n\\nEvery few weeks she would shut herself up in her room, put on her\\nscribbling suit, and \\'fall into a vortex\\', as she expressed it, writing\\naway at her novel with all her heart and soul, for till that was\\nfinished she could find no peace.  Her \\'scribbling suit\\' consisted of a\\nblack woolen pinafore on which she could wipe her pen at will, and a\\ncap of the same material, adorned with a cheerful red bow, into which\\nshe bundled her hair when the decks were cleared for action.  This cap\\nwas a beacon to the inquiring eyes of her family, who during these\\nperiods kept their distance, merely popping in their heads\\nsemi-occasionally to ask, with interest, \"Does genius burn, Jo?\" They\\ndid not always venture even to ask this question, but took an\\nobservation of the cap, and judged accordingly.  If this expressive\\narticle of dress was drawn low upon the forehead, it was a sign that\\nhard work was going on, in exciting moments it was pushed rakishly\\naskew, and when despair seized the author it was plucked wholly off,\\nand cast upon the floor.  At such times the intruder silently withdrew,\\nand not until the red bow was seen gaily erect upon the gifted brow,\\ndid anyone dare address Jo.\\n\\nShe did not think herself a genius by any means, but when the writing\\nfit came on, she gave herself up to it with entire abandon, and led a\\nblissful life, unconscious of want, care, or bad weather, while she sat\\nsafe and happy in an imaginary world, full of friends almost as real\\nand dear to her as any in the flesh.  Sleep forsook her eyes, meals\\nstood untasted, day and night were all too short to enjoy the happiness\\nwhich blessed her only at such times, and made these hours worth\\nliving, even if they bore no other fruit.  The divine afflatus usually\\nlasted a week or two, and then she emerged from her \\'vortex\\', hungry,\\nsleepy, cross, or despondent.\\n\\nShe was just recovering from one of these attacks when she was\\nprevailed upon to escort Miss Crocker to a lecture, and in return for\\nher virtue was rewarded with a new idea.  It was a People\\'s Course, the\\nlecture on the Pyramids, and Jo rather wondered at the choice of such a\\nsubject for such an audience, but took it for granted that some great\\nsocial evil would be remedied or some great want supplied by unfolding\\nthe glories of the Pharaohs to an audience whose thoughts were busy\\nwith the price of coal and flour, and whose lives were spent in trying\\nto solve harder riddles than that of the Sphinx.\\n\\nThey were early, and while Miss Crocker set the heel of her stocking,\\nJo amused herself by examining the faces of the people who occupied the\\nseat with them.  On her left were two matrons, with massive foreheads\\nand bonnets to match, discussing Women\\'s Rights and making tatting.\\nBeyond sat a pair of humble lovers, artlessly holding each other by the\\nhand, a somber spinster eating peppermints out of a paper bag, and an\\nold gentleman taking his preparatory nap behind a yellow bandanna.  On\\nher right, her only neighbor was a studious looking lad absorbed in a\\nnewspaper.\\n\\nIt was a pictorial sheet, and Jo examined the work of art nearest her,\\nidly wondering what fortuitous concatenation of circumstances needed\\nthe melodramatic illustration of an Indian in full war costume,\\ntumbling over a precipice with a wolf at his throat, while two\\ninfuriated young gentlemen, with unnaturally small feet and big eyes,\\nwere stabbing each other close by, and a disheveled female was flying\\naway in the background with her mouth wide open.  Pausing to turn a\\npage, the lad saw her looking and, with boyish good nature offered half\\nhis paper, saying bluntly, \"want to read it? That\\'s a first-rate story.\"\\n\\nJo accepted it with a smile, for she had never outgrown her liking for\\nlads, and soon found herself involved in the usual labyrinth of love,\\nmystery, and murder, for the story belonged to that class of light\\nliterature in which the passions have a holiday, and when the author\\'s\\ninvention fails, a grand catastrophe clears the stage of one half the\\ndramatis personae, leaving the other half to exult over their downfall.\\n\\n\"Prime, isn\\'t it?\" asked the boy, as her eye went down the last\\nparagraph of her portion.\\n\\n\"I think you and I could do as well as that if we tried,\" returned Jo,\\namused at his admiration of the trash.\\n\\n\"I should think I was a pretty lucky chap if I could.  She makes a good\\nliving out of such stories, they say.\" and he pointed to the name of\\nMrs. S.L.A.N.G.  Northbury, under the title of the tale.\\n\\n\"Do you know her?\" asked Jo, with sudden interest.\\n\\n\"No, but I read all her pieces, and I know a fellow who works in the\\noffice where this paper is printed.\"\\n\\n\"Do you say she makes a good living out of stories like this?\" and Jo\\nlooked more respectfully at the agitated group and thickly sprinkled\\nexclamation points that adorned the page.\\n\\n\"Guess she does!  She knows just what folks like, and gets paid well\\nfor writing it.\"\\n\\nHere the lecture began, but Jo heard very little of it, for while\\nProfessor Sands was prosing away about Belzoni, Cheops, scarabei, and\\nhieroglyphics, she was covertly taking down the address of the paper,\\nand boldly resolving to try for the hundred-dollar prize offered in its\\ncolumns for a sensational story.  By the time the lecture ended and the\\naudience awoke, she had built up a splendid fortune for herself (not\\nthe first founded on paper), and was already deep in the concoction of\\nher story, being unable to decide whether the duel should come before\\nthe elopement or after the murder.\\n\\nShe said nothing of her plan at home, but fell to work next day, much\\nto the disquiet of her mother, who always looked a little anxious when\\n\\'genius took to burning\\'.  Jo had never tried this style before,\\ncontenting herself with very mild romances for _The Spread Eagle_.  Her\\nexperience and miscellaneous reading were of service now, for they gave\\nher some idea of dramatic effect, and supplied plot, language, and\\ncostumes.  Her story was as full of desperation and despair as her\\nlimited acquaintance with those uncomfortable emotions enabled her to\\nmake it, and having located it in Lisbon, she wound up with an\\nearthquake, as a striking and appropriate denouement.  The manuscript\\nwas privately dispatched, accompanied by a note, modestly saying that\\nif the tale didn\\'t get the prize, which the writer hardly dared expect,\\nshe would be very glad to receive any sum it might be considered worth.\\n\\nSix weeks is a long time to wait, and a still longer time for a girl to\\nkeep a secret, but Jo did both, and was just beginning to give up all\\nhope of ever seeing her manuscript again, when a letter arrived which\\nalmost took her breath away, for on opening it, a check for a hundred\\ndollars fell into her lap.  For a minute she stared at it as if it had\\nbeen a snake, then she read her letter and began to cry.  If the\\namiable gentleman who wrote that kindly note could have known what\\nintense happiness he was giving a fellow creature, I think he would\\ndevote his leisure hours, if he has any, to that amusement, for Jo\\nvalued the letter more than the money, because it was encouraging, and\\nafter years of effort it was so pleasant to find that she had learned\\nto do something, though it was only to write a sensation story.\\n\\nA prouder young woman was seldom seen than she, when, having composed\\nherself, she electrified the family by appearing before them with the\\nletter in one hand, the check in the other, announcing that she had won\\nthe prize.  Of course there was a great jubilee, and when the story\\ncame everyone read and praised it, though after her father had told her\\nthat the language was good, the romance fresh and hearty, and the\\ntragedy quite thrilling, he shook his head, and said in his unworldly\\nway...\\n\\n\"You can do better than this, Jo.  Aim at the highest, and never mind\\nthe money.\"\\n\\n\"I think the money is the best part of it.  What will you do with such\\na fortune?\" asked Amy, regarding the magic slip of paper with a\\nreverential eye.\\n\\n\"Send Beth and Mother to the seaside for a month or two,\" answered Jo\\npromptly.\\n\\nTo the seaside they went, after much discussion, and though Beth didn\\'t\\ncome home as plump and rosy as could be desired, she was much better,\\nwhile Mrs. March declared she felt ten years younger.  So Jo was\\nsatisfied with the investment of her prize money, and fell to work with\\na cheery spirit, bent on earning more of those delightful checks. She\\ndid earn several that year, and began to feel herself a power in the\\nhouse, for by the magic of a pen, her \\'rubbish\\' turned into comforts\\nfor them all.  The Duke\\'s Daughter paid the butcher\\'s bill, A Phantom\\nHand put down a new carpet, and the Curse of the Coventrys proved the\\nblessing of the Marches in the way of groceries and gowns.\\n\\nWealth is certainly a most desirable thing, but poverty has its sunny\\nside, and one of the sweet uses of adversity is the genuine\\nsatisfaction which comes from hearty work of head or hand, and to the\\ninspiration of necessity, we owe half the wise, beautiful, and useful\\nblessings of the world.  Jo enjoyed a taste of this satisfaction, and\\nceased to envy richer girls, taking great comfort in the knowledge that\\nshe could supply her own wants, and need ask no one for a penny.\\n\\nLittle notice was taken of her stories, but they found a market, and\\nencouraged by this fact, she resolved to make a bold stroke for fame\\nand fortune.  Having copied her novel for the fourth time, read it to\\nall her confidential friends, and submitted it with fear and trembling\\nto three publishers, she at last disposed of it, on condition that she\\nwould cut it down one third, and omit all the parts which she\\nparticularly admired.\\n\\n\"Now I must either bundle it back in to my tin kitchen to mold, pay for\\nprinting it myself, or chop it up to suit purchasers and get what I can\\nfor it.  Fame is a very good thing to have in the house, but cash is\\nmore convenient, so I wish to take the sense of the meeting on this\\nimportant subject,\" said Jo, calling a family council.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t spoil your book, my girl, for there is more in it than you know,\\nand the idea is well worked out.  Let it wait and ripen,\" was her\\nfather\\'s advice, and he practiced what he preached, having waited\\npatiently thirty years for fruit of his own to ripen, and being in no\\nhaste to gather it even now when it was sweet and mellow.\\n\\n\"It seems to me that Jo will profit more by taking the trial than by\\nwaiting,\" said Mrs. March.  \"Criticism is the best test of such work,\\nfor it will show her both unsuspected merits and faults, and help her\\nto do better next time.  We are too partial, but the praise and blame\\nof outsiders will prove useful, even if she gets but little money.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Jo, knitting her brows, \"that\\'s just it.  I\\'ve been fussing\\nover the thing so long, I really don\\'t know whether it\\'s good, bad, or\\nindifferent.  It will be a great help to have cool, impartial persons\\ntake a look at it, and tell me what they think of it.\"\\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t leave a word out of it.  You\\'ll spoil it if you do, for the\\ninterest of the story is more in the minds than in the actions of the\\npeople, and it will be all a muddle if you don\\'t explain as you go on,\"\\nsaid Meg, who firmly believed that this book was the most remarkable\\nnovel ever written.\\n\\n\"But Mr. Allen says, \\'Leave out the explanations, make it brief and\\ndramatic, and let the characters tell the story\\',\" interrupted Jo,\\nturning to the publisher\\'s note.\\n\\n\"Do as he tells you.  He knows what will sell, and we don\\'t. Make a\\ngood, popular book, and get as much money as you can. By-and-by, when\\nyou\\'ve got a name, you can afford to digress, and have philosophical\\nand metaphysical people in your novels,\" said Amy, who took a strictly\\npractical view of the subject.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Jo, laughing, \"if my people are \\'philosophical and\\nmetaphysical\\', it isn\\'t my fault, for I know nothing about such things,\\nexcept what I hear father say, sometimes.  If I\\'ve got some of his wise\\nideas jumbled up with my romance, so much the better for me.  Now,\\nBeth, what do you say?\"\\n\\n\"I should so like to see it printed soon,\" was all Beth said, and\\nsmiled in saying it.  But there was an unconscious emphasis on the last\\nword, and a wistful look in the eyes that never lost their childlike\\ncandor, which chilled Jo\\'s heart for a minute with a forboding fear,\\nand decided her to make her little venture \\'soon\\'.\\n\\nSo, with Spartan firmness, the young authoress laid her first-born on\\nher table, and chopped it up as ruthlessly as any ogre.  In the hope of\\npleasing everyone, she took everyone\\'s advice, and like the old man and\\nhis donkey in the fable suited nobody.\\n\\nHer father liked the metaphysical streak which had unconsciously got\\ninto it, so that was allowed to remain though she had her doubts about\\nit.  Her mother thought that there was a trifle too much description.\\nOut, therefore it came, and with it many necessary links in the story.\\nMeg admired the tragedy, so Jo piled up the agony to suit her, while\\nAmy objected to the fun, and, with the best intentions in life, Jo\\nquenched the spritly scenes which relieved the somber character of the\\nstory.  Then, to complicate the ruin, she cut it down one third, and\\nconfidingly sent the poor little romance, like a picked robin, out into\\nthe big, busy world to try its fate.\\n\\nWell, it was printed, and she got three hundred dollars for it,\\nlikewise plenty of praise and blame, both so much greater than she\\nexpected that she was thrown into a state of bewilderment from which it\\ntook her some time to recover.\\n\\n\"You said, Mother, that criticism would help me.  But how can it, when\\nit\\'s so contradictory that I don\\'t know whether I\\'ve written a\\npromising book or broken all the ten commandments?\" cried poor Jo,\\nturning over a heap of notices, the perusal of which filled her with\\npride and joy one minute, wrath and dismay the next.  \"This man says,\\n\\'An exquisite book, full of truth, beauty, and earnestness.\\' \\'All is\\nsweet, pure, and healthy.\\'\" continued the perplexed authoress.  \"The\\nnext, \\'The theory of the book is bad, full of morbid fancies,\\nspiritualistic ideas, and unnatural characters.\\' Now, as I had no\\ntheory of any kind, don\\'t believe in Spiritualism, and copied my\\ncharacters from life, I don\\'t see how this critic can be right.\\nAnother says, \\'It\\'s one of the best American novels which has appeared\\nfor years.\\' (I know better than that), and the next asserts that\\n\\'Though it is original, and written with great force and feeling, it is\\na dangerous book.\\' \\'Tisn\\'t!  Some make fun of it, some overpraise, and\\nnearly all insist that I had a deep theory to expound, when I only\\nwrote it for the pleasure and the money.  I wish I\\'d printed the whole\\nor not at all, for I do hate to be so misjudged.\"\\n\\nHer family and friends administered comfort and commendation liberally.\\nYet it was a hard time for sensitive, high-spirited Jo, who meant so\\nwell and had apparently done so ill.  But it did her good, for those\\nwhose opinion had real value gave her the criticism which is an\\nauthor\\'s best education, and when the first soreness was over, she\\ncould laugh at her poor little book, yet believe in it still, and feel\\nherself the wiser and stronger for the buffeting she had received.\\n\\n\"Not being a genius, like Keats, it won\\'t kill me,\" she said stoutly,\\n\"and I\\'ve got the joke on my side, after all, for the parts that were\\ntaken straight out of real life are denounced as impossible and absurd,\\nand the scenes that I made up out of my own silly head are pronounced\\n\\'charmingly natural, tender, and true\\'.  So I\\'ll comfort myself with\\nthat, and when I\\'m ready, I\\'ll up again and take another.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'TWENTY-EIGHT\\n\\nDOMESTIC EXPERIENCES\\n\\nLike most other young matrons, Meg began her married life with the\\ndetermination to be a model housekeeper.  John should find home a\\nparadise, he should always see a smiling face, should fare sumptuously\\nevery day, and never know the loss of a button.  She brought so much\\nlove, energy, and cheerfulness to the work that she could not but\\nsucceed, in spite of some obstacles.  Her paradise was not a tranquil\\none, for the little woman fussed, was over-anxious to please, and\\nbustled about like a true Martha, cumbered with many cares.  She was\\ntoo tired, sometimes, even to smile, John grew dyspeptic after a course\\nof dainty dishes and ungratefully demanded plain fare.  As for buttons,\\nshe soon learned to wonder where they went, to shake her head over the\\ncarelessness of men, and to threaten to make him sew them on himself,\\nand see if his work would stand impatient and clumsy fingers any better\\nthan hers.\\n\\nThey were very happy, even after they discovered that they couldn\\'t\\nlive on love alone.  John did not find Meg\\'s beauty diminished, though\\nshe beamed at him from behind the familiar coffee pot.  Nor did Meg\\nmiss any of the romance from the daily parting, when her husband\\nfollowed up his kiss with the tender inquiry, \"Shall I send some veal\\nor mutton for dinner, darling?\" The little house ceased to be a\\nglorified bower, but it became a home, and the young couple soon felt\\nthat it was a change for the better.  At first they played keep-house,\\nand frolicked over it like children.  Then John took steadily to\\nbusiness, feeling the cares of the head of a family upon his shoulders,\\nand Meg laid by her cambric wrappers, put on a big apron, and fell to\\nwork, as before said, with more energy than discretion.\\n\\nWhile the cooking mania lasted she went through Mrs. Cornelius\\'s\\nReceipt Book as if it were a mathematical exercise, working out the\\nproblems with patience and care.  Sometimes her family were invited in\\nto help eat up a too bounteous feast of successes, or Lotty would be\\nprivately dispatched with a batch of failures, which were to be\\nconcealed from all eyes in the convenient stomachs of the little\\nHummels.  An evening with John over the account books usually produced\\na temporary lull in the culinary enthusiasm, and a frugal fit would\\nensue, during which the poor man was put through a course of bread\\npudding, hash, and warmed-over coffee, which tried his soul, although\\nhe bore it with praiseworthy fortitude.  Before the golden mean was\\nfound, however, Meg added to her domestic possessions what young\\ncouples seldom get on long without, a family jar.\\n\\nFired with a housewifely wish to see her storeroom stocked with\\nhomemade preserves, she undertook to put up her own currant jelly. John\\nwas requested to order home a dozen or so of little pots and an extra\\nquantity of sugar, for their own currants were ripe and were to be\\nattended to at once.  As John firmly believed that \\'my wife\\' was equal\\nto anything, and took a natural pride in her skill, he resolved that\\nshe should be gratified, and their only crop of fruit laid by in a most\\npleasing form for winter use.  Home came four dozen delightful little\\npots, half a barrel of sugar, and a small boy to pick the currants for\\nher.  With her pretty hair tucked into a little cap, arms bared to the\\nelbow, and a checked apron which had a coquettish look in spite of the\\nbib, the young housewife fell to work, feeling no doubts about her\\nsuccess, for hadn\\'t she seen Hannah do it hundreds of times?  The array\\nof pots rather amazed her at first, but John was so fond of jelly, and\\nthe nice little jars would look so well on the top shelf, that Meg\\nresolved to fill them all, and spent a long day picking, boiling,\\nstraining, and fussing over her jelly.  She did her best, she asked\\nadvice of Mrs. Cornelius, she racked her brain to remember what Hannah\\ndid that she left undone, she reboiled, resugared, and restrained, but\\nthat dreadful stuff wouldn\\'t \\'jell\\'.\\n\\nShe longed to run home, bib and all, and ask Mother to lend her a hand,\\nbut John and she had agreed that they would never annoy anyone with\\ntheir private worries, experiments, or quarrels.  They had laughed over\\nthat last word as if the idea it suggested was a most preposterous one,\\nbut they had held to their resolve, and whenever they could get on\\nwithout help they did so, and no one interfered, for Mrs. March had\\nadvised the plan.  So Meg wrestled alone with the refractory sweetmeats\\nall that hot summer day, and at five o\\'clock sat down in her\\ntopsy-turvey kitchen, wrung her bedaubed hands, lifted up her voice and\\nwept.\\n\\nNow, in the first flush of the new life, she had often said, \"My\\nhusband shall always feel free to bring a friend home whenever he\\nlikes.  I shall always be prepared.  There shall be no flurry, no\\nscolding, no discomfort, but a neat house, a cheerful wife, and a good\\ndinner.  John, dear, never stop to ask my leave, invite whom you\\nplease, and be sure of a welcome from me.\"\\n\\nHow charming that was, to be sure!  John quite glowed with pride to\\nhear her say it, and felt what a blessed thing it was to have a\\nsuperior wife.  But, although they had had company from time to time,\\nit never happened to be unexpected, and Meg had never had an\\nopportunity to distinguish herself till now.  It always happens so in\\nthis vale of tears, there is an inevitability about such things which\\nwe can only wonder at, deplore, and bear as we best can.\\n\\nIf John had not forgotten all about the jelly, it really would have\\nbeen unpardonable in him to choose that day, of all the days in the\\nyear, to bring a friend home to dinner unexpectedly.  Congratulating\\nhimself that a handsome repast had been ordered that morning, feeling\\nsure that it would be ready to the minute, and indulging in pleasant\\nanticipations of the charming effect it would produce, when his pretty\\nwife came running out to meet him, he escorted his friend to his\\nmansion, with the irrepressible satisfaction of a young host and\\nhusband.\\n\\nIt is a world of disappointments, as John discovered when he reached\\nthe Dovecote.  The front door usually stood hospitably open. Now it was\\nnot only shut, but locked, and yesterday\\'s mud still adorned the steps.\\nThe parlor windows were closed and curtained, no picture of the pretty\\nwife sewing on the piazza, in white, with a distracting little bow in\\nher hair, or a bright-eyed hostess, smiling a shy welcome as she\\ngreeted her guest.  Nothing of the sort, for not a soul appeared but a\\nsanginary-looking boy asleep under the current bushes.\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid something has happened.  Step into the garden, Scott, while\\nI look up Mrs. Brooke,\" said John, alarmed at the silence and solitude.\\n\\nRound the house he hurried, led by a pungent smell of burned sugar, and\\nMr. Scott strolled after him, with a queer look on his face.  He paused\\ndiscreetly at a distance when Brooke disappeared, but he could both see\\nand hear, and being a bachelor, enjoyed the prospect mightily.\\n\\nIn the kitchen reigned confusion and despair.  One edition of jelly was\\ntrickled from pot to pot, another lay upon the floor, and a third was\\nburning gaily on the stove.  Lotty, with Teutonic phlegm, was calmly\\neating bread and currant wine, for the jelly was still in a hopelessly\\nliquid state, while Mrs. Brooke, with her apron over her head, sat\\nsobbing dismally.\\n\\n\"My dearest girl, what is the matter?\" cried John, rushing in, with\\nawful visions of scalded hands, sudden news of affliction, and secret\\nconsternation at the thought of the guest in the garden.\\n\\n\"Oh, John, I am so tired and hot and cross and worried!  I\\'ve been at\\nit till I\\'m all worn out.  Do come and help me or I shall die!\" and the\\nexhausted housewife cast herself upon his breast, giving him a sweet\\nwelcome in every sense of the word, for her pinafore had been baptized\\nat the same time as the floor.\\n\\n\"What worries you dear?  Has anything dreadful happened?\" asked the\\nanxious John, tenderly kissing the crown of the little cap, which was\\nall askew.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" sobbed Meg despairingly.\\n\\n\"Tell me quick, then.  Don\\'t cry.  I can bear anything better than\\nthat.  Out with it, love.\"\\n\\n\"The... The jelly won\\'t jell and I don\\'t know what to do!\"\\n\\nJohn Brooke laughed then as he never dared to laugh afterward, and the\\nderisive Scott smiled involuntarily as he heard the hearty peal, which\\nput the finishing stroke to poor Meg\\'s woe.\\n\\n\"Is that all?  Fling it out of the window, and don\\'t bother any more\\nabout it.  I\\'ll buy you quarts if you want it, but for heaven\\'s sake\\ndon\\'t have hysterics, for I\\'ve brought Jack Scott home to dinner,\\nand...\"\\n\\nJohn got no further, for Meg cast him off, and clasped her hands with a\\ntragic gesture as she fell into a chair, exclaiming in a tone of\\nmingled indignation, reproach, and dismay...\\n\\n\"A man to dinner, and everything in a mess!  John Brooke, how could you\\ndo such a thing?\"\\n\\n\"Hush, he\\'s in the garden!  I forgot the confounded jelly, but it can\\'t\\nbe helped now,\" said John, surveying the prospect with an anxious eye.\\n\\n\"You ought to have sent word, or told me this morning, and you ought to\\nhave remembered how busy I was,\" continued Meg petulantly, for even\\nturtledoves will peck when ruffled.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t know it this morning, and there was no time to send word, for\\nI met him on the way out.  I never thought of asking leave, when you\\nhave always told me to do as I liked.  I never tried it before, and\\nhang me if I ever do again!\" added John, with an aggrieved air.\\n\\n\"I should hope not!  Take him away at once.  I can\\'t see him, and there\\nisn\\'t any dinner.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I like that!  Where\\'s the beef and vegetables I sent home, and\\nthe pudding you promised?\" cried John, rushing to the larder.\\n\\n\"I hadn\\'t time to cook anything.  I meant to dine at Mother\\'s. I\\'m\\nsorry, but I was so busy,\" and Meg\\'s tears began again.\\n\\nJohn was a mild man, but he was human, and after a long day\\'s work to\\ncome home tired, hungry, and hopeful, to find a chaotic house, an empty\\ntable, and a cross wife was not exactly conducive to repose of mind or\\nmanner.  He restrained himself however, and the little squall would\\nhave blown over, but for one unlucky word.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a scrape, I acknowledge, but if you will lend a hand, we\\'ll pull\\nthrough and have a good time yet.  Don\\'t cry, dear, but just exert\\nyourself a bit, and fix us up something to eat.  We\\'re both as hungry\\nas hunters, so we shan\\'t mind what it is.  Give us the cold meat, and\\nbread and cheese.  We won\\'t ask for jelly.\"\\n\\nHe meant it to be a good-natured joke, but that one word sealed his\\nfate.  Meg thought it was too cruel to hint about her sad failure, and\\nthe last atom of patience vanished as he spoke.\\n\\n\"You must get yourself out of the scrape as you can.  I\\'m too used up\\nto \\'exert\\' myself for anyone.  It\\'s like a man to propose a bone and\\nvulgar bread and cheese for company.  I won\\'t have anything of the sort\\nin my house.  Take that Scott up to Mother\\'s, and tell him I\\'m away,\\nsick, dead, anything.  I won\\'t see him, and you two can laugh at me and\\nmy jelly as much as you like.  You won\\'t have anything else here.\"  and\\nhaving delivered her defiance all on one breath, Meg cast away her\\npinafore and precipitately left the field to bemoan herself in her own\\nroom.\\n\\nWhat those two creatures did in her absence, she never knew, but Mr.\\nScott was not taken \\'up to Mother\\'s\\', and when Meg descended, after\\nthey had strolled away together, she found traces of a promiscuous\\nlunch which filled her with horror.  Lotty reported that they had eaten\\n\"a much, and greatly laughed, and the master bid her throw away all the\\nsweet stuff, and hide the pots.\"\\n\\nMeg longed to go and tell Mother, but a sense of shame at her own\\nshort-comings, of loyalty to John, \"who might be cruel, but nobody\\nshould know it,\" restrained her, and after a summary cleaning up, she\\ndressed herself prettily, and sat down to wait for John to come and be\\nforgiven.\\n\\nUnfortunately, John didn\\'t come, not seeing the matter in that light.\\nHe had carried it off as a good joke with Scott, excused his little\\nwife as well as he could, and played the host so hospitably that his\\nfriend enjoyed the impromptu dinner, and promised to come again, but\\nJohn was angry, though he did not show it, he felt that Meg had\\ndeserted him in his hour of need.  \"It wasn\\'t fair to tell a man to\\nbring folks home any time, with perfect freedom, and when he took you\\nat your word, to flame up and blame him, and leave him in the lurch, to\\nbe laughed at or pitied.  No, by George, it wasn\\'t! And Meg must know\\nit.\"\\n\\nHe had fumed inwardly during the feast, but when the flurry was over\\nand he strolled home after seeing Scott off, a milder mood came over\\nhim.  \"Poor little thing!  It was hard upon her when she tried so\\nheartily to please me.  She was wrong, of course, but then she was\\nyoung.  I must be patient and teach her.\"  He hoped she had not gone\\nhome--he hated gossip and interference.  For a minute he was ruffled\\nagain at the mere thought of it, and then the fear that Meg would cry\\nherself sick softened his heart, and sent him on at a quicker pace,\\nresolving to be calm and kind, but firm, quite firm, and show her where\\nshe had failed in her duty to her spouse.\\n\\nMeg likewise resolved to be \\'calm and kind, but firm\\', and show him his\\nduty.  She longed to run to meet him, and beg pardon, and be kissed and\\ncomforted, as she was sure of being, but, of course, she did nothing of\\nthe sort, and when she saw John coming, began to hum quite naturally,\\nas she rocked and sewed, like a lady of leisure in her best parlor.\\n\\nJohn was a little disappointed not to find a tender Niobe, but feeling\\nthat his dignity demanded the first apology, he made none, only came\\nleisurely in and laid himself upon the sofa with the singularly\\nrelevant remark, \"We are going to have a new moon, my dear.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve no objection,\" was Meg\\'s equally soothing remark.  A few other\\ntopics of general interest were introduced by Mr. Brooke and\\nwet-blanketed by Mrs. Brooke, and conversation languished.  John went\\nto one window, unfolded his paper, and wrapped himself in it,\\nfiguratively speaking.  Meg went to the other window, and sewed as if\\nnew rosettes for slippers were among the necessaries of life. Neither\\nspoke.  Both looked quite \\'calm and firm\\', and both felt desperately\\nuncomfortable.\\n\\n\"Oh, dear,\" thought Meg, \"married life is very trying, and does need\\ninfinite patience as well as love, as Mother says.\"  The word \\'Mother\\'\\nsuggested other maternal counsels given long ago, and received with\\nunbelieving protests.\\n\\n\"John is a good man, but he has his faults, and you must learn to see\\nand bear with them, remembering your own.  He is very decided, but\\nnever will be obstinate, if you reason kindly, not oppose impatiently.\\nHe is very accurate, and particular about the truth--a good trait,\\nthough you call him \\'fussy\\'. Never deceive him by look or word, Meg,\\nand he will give you the confidence you deserve, the support you need.\\nHe has a temper, not like ours--one flash and then all over--but the\\nwhite, still anger that is seldom stirred, but once kindled is hard to\\nquench.  Be careful, be very careful, not to wake his anger against\\nyourself, for peace and happiness depend on keeping his respect.  Watch\\nyourself, be the first to ask pardon if you both err, and guard against\\nthe little piques, misunderstandings, and hasty words that often pave\\nthe way for bitter sorrow and regret.\"\\n\\nThese words came back to Meg, as she sat sewing in the sunset,\\nespecially the last.  This was the first serious disagreement, her own\\nhasty speeches sounded both silly and unkind, as she recalled them, her\\nown anger looked childish now, and thoughts of poor John coming home to\\nsuch a scene quite melted her heart.  She glanced at him with tears in\\nher eyes, but he did not see them.  She put down her work and got up,\\nthinking, \"I will be the first to say, \\'Forgive me\\'\", but he did not\\nseem to hear her.  She went very slowly across the room, for pride was\\nhard to swallow, and stood by him, but he did not turn his head.  For a\\nminute she felt as if she really couldn\\'t do it, then came the thought,\\n\"This is the beginning. I\\'ll do my part, and have nothing to reproach\\nmyself with,\" and stooping down, she softly kissed her husband on the\\nforehead. Of course that settled it.  The penitent kiss was better than\\na world of words, and John had her on his knee in a minute, saying\\ntenderly...\\n\\n\"It was too bad to laugh at the poor little jelly pots. Forgive me,\\ndear.  I never will again!\"\\n\\nBut he did, oh bless you, yes, hundreds of times, and so did Meg, both\\ndeclaring that it was the sweetest jelly they ever made, for family\\npeace was preserved in that little family jar.\\n\\nAfter this, Meg had Mr. Scott to dinner by special invitation, and\\nserved him up a pleasant feast without a cooked wife for the first\\ncourse, on which occasion she was so gay and gracious, and made\\neverything go off so charmingly, that Mr. Scott told John he was a\\nlucky fellow, and shook his head over the hardships of bachelorhood all\\nthe way home.\\n\\nIn the autumn, new trials and experiences came to Meg.  Sallie Moffat\\nrenewed her friendship, was always running out for a dish of gossip at\\nthe little house, or inviting \\'that poor dear\\' to come in and spend the\\nday at the big house.  It was pleasant, for in dull weather Meg often\\nfelt lonely.  All were busy at home, John absent till night, and\\nnothing to do but sew, or read, or potter about.  So it naturally fell\\nout that Meg got into the way of gadding and gossiping with her friend.\\nSeeing Sallie\\'s pretty things made her long for such, and pity herself\\nbecause she had not got them.  Sallie was very kind, and often offered\\nher the coveted trifles, but Meg declined them, knowing that John\\nwouldn\\'t like it, and then this foolish little woman went and did what\\nJohn disliked even worse.\\n\\nShe knew her husband\\'s income, and she loved to feel that he trusted\\nher, not only with his happiness, but what some men seem to value\\nmore--his money.  She knew where it was, was free to take what she\\nliked, and all he asked was that she should keep account of every\\npenny, pay bills once a month, and remember that she was a poor man\\'s\\nwife.  Till now she had done well, been prudent and exact, kept her\\nlittle account books neatly, and showed them to him monthly without\\nfear.  But that autumn the serpent got into Meg\\'s paradise, and tempted\\nher like many a modern Eve, not with apples, but with dress.  Meg\\ndidn\\'t like to be pitied and made to feel poor.  It irritated her, but\\nshe was ashamed to confess it, and now and then she tried to console\\nherself by buying something pretty, so that Sallie needn\\'t think she\\nhad to economize.  She always felt wicked after it, for the pretty\\nthings were seldom necessaries, but then they cost so little, it wasn\\'t\\nworth worrying about, so the trifles increased unconsciously, and in\\nthe shopping excursions she was no longer a passive looker-on.\\n\\nBut the trifles cost more than one would imagine, and when she cast up\\nher accounts at the end of the month the sum total rather scared her.\\nJohn was busy that month and left the bills to her, the next month he\\nwas absent, but the third he had a grand quarterly settling up, and Meg\\nnever forgot it.  A few days before she had done a dreadful thing, and\\nit weighed upon her conscience.  Sallie had been buying silks, and Meg\\nlonged for a new one, just a handsome light one for parties, her black\\nsilk was so common, and thin things for evening wear were only proper\\nfor girls.  Aunt March usually gave the sisters a present of\\ntwenty-five dollars apiece at New Year\\'s.  That was only a month to\\nwait, and here was a lovely violet silk going at a bargain, and she had\\nthe money, if she only dared to take it.  John always said what was his\\nwas hers, but would he think it right to spend not only the prospective\\nfive-and-twenty, but another five-and-twenty out of the household fund?\\nThat was the question. Sallie had urged her to do it, had offered to\\nlend the money, and with the best intentions in life had tempted Meg\\nbeyond her strength. In an evil moment the shopman held up the lovely,\\nshimmering folds, and said, \"A bargain, I assure, you, ma\\'am.\" She\\nanswered, \"I\\'ll take it,\" and it was cut off and paid for, and Sallie\\nhad exulted, and she had laughed as if it were a thing of no\\nconsequence, and driven away, feeling as if she had stolen something,\\nand the police were after her.\\n\\nWhen she got home, she tried to assuage the pangs of remorse by\\nspreading forth the lovely silk, but it looked less silvery now, didn\\'t\\nbecome her, after all, and the words \\'fifty dollars\\' seemed stamped\\nlike a pattern down each breadth.  She put it away, but it haunted her,\\nnot delightfully as a new dress should, but dreadfully like the ghost\\nof a folly that was not easily laid.  When John got out his books that\\nnight, Meg\\'s heart sank, and for the first time in her married life,\\nshe was afraid of her husband.  The kind, brown eyes looked as if they\\ncould be stern, and though he was unusually merry, she fancied he had\\nfound her out, but didn\\'t mean to let her know it.  The house bills\\nwere all paid, the books all in order. John had praised her, and was\\nundoing the old pocketbook which they called the \\'bank\\', when Meg,\\nknowing that it was quite empty, stopped his hand, saying nervously...\\n\\n\"You haven\\'t seen my private expense book yet.\"\\n\\nJohn never asked to see it, but she always insisted on his doing so,\\nand used to enjoy his masculine amazement at the queer things women\\nwanted, and made him guess what piping was, demand fiercely the meaning\\nof a hug-me-tight, or wonder how a little thing composed of three\\nrosebuds, a bit of velvet, and a pair of strings, could possibly be a\\nbonnet, and cost six dollars.  That night he looked as if he would like\\nthe fun of quizzing her figures and pretending to be horrified at her\\nextravagance, as he often did, being particularly proud of his prudent\\nwife.\\n\\nThe little book was brought slowly out and laid down before him. Meg\\ngot behind his chair under pretense of smoothing the wrinkles out of\\nhis tired forehead, and standing there, she said, with her panic\\nincreasing with every word...\\n\\n\"John, dear, I\\'m ashamed to show you my book, for I\\'ve really been\\ndreadfully extravagant lately.  I go about so much I must have things,\\nyou know, and Sallie advised my getting it, so I did, and my New Year\\'s\\nmoney will partly pay for it, but I was sorry after I had done it, for\\nI knew you\\'d think it wrong in me.\"\\n\\nJohn laughed, and drew her round beside him, saying goodhumoredly,\\n\"Don\\'t go and hide.  I won\\'t beat you if you have got a pair of killing\\nboots.  I\\'m rather proud of my wife\\'s feet, and don\\'t mind if she does\\npay eight or nine dollars for her boots, if they are good ones.\"\\n\\nThat had been one of her last \\'trifles\\', and John\\'s eye had fallen on\\nit as he spoke.  \"Oh, what will he say when he comes to that awful\\nfifty dollars!\" thought Meg, with a shiver.\\n\\n\"It\\'s worse than boots, it\\'s a silk dress,\" she said, with the calmness\\nof desperation, for she wanted the worst over.\\n\\n\"Well, dear, what is the \\'dem\\'d total\\', as Mr. Mantalini says?\"\\n\\nThat didn\\'t sound like John, and she knew he was looking up at her with\\nthe straightforward look that she had always been ready to meet and\\nanswer with one as frank till now.  She turned the page and her head at\\nthe same time, pointing to the sum which would have been bad enough\\nwithout the fifty, but which was appalling to her with that added.  For\\na minute the room was very still, then John said slowly--but she could\\nfeel it cost him an effort to express no displeasure--. . .\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know that fifty is much for a dress, with all the\\nfurbelows and notions you have to have to finish it off these days.\"\\n\\n\"It isn\\'t made or trimmed,\" sighed Meg, faintly, for a sudden\\nrecollection of the cost still to be incurred quite overwhelmed her.\\n\\n\"Twenty-five yards of silk seems a good deal to cover one small woman,\\nbut I\\'ve no doubt my wife will look as fine as Ned Moffat\\'s when she\\ngets it on,\" said John dryly.\\n\\n\"I know you are angry, John, but I can\\'t help it.  I don\\'t mean to\\nwaste your money, and I didn\\'t think those little things would count up\\nso.  I can\\'t resist them when I see Sallie buying all she wants, and\\npitying me because I don\\'t.  I try to be contented, but it is hard, and\\nI\\'m tired of being poor.\"\\n\\nThe last words were spoken so low she thought he did not hear them, but\\nhe did, and they wounded him deeply, for he had denied himself many\\npleasures for Meg\\'s sake.  She could have bitten her tongue out the\\nminute she had said it, for John pushed the books away and got up,\\nsaying with a little quiver in his voice, \"I was afraid of this.  I do\\nmy best, Meg.\"  If he had scolded her, or even shaken her, it would not\\nhave broken her heart like those few words.  She ran to him and held\\nhim close, crying, with repentant tears, \"Oh, John, my dear, kind,\\nhard-working boy.  I didn\\'t mean it!  It was so wicked, so untrue and\\nungrateful, how could I say it! Oh, how could I say it!\"\\n\\nHe was very kind, forgave her readily, and did not utter one reproach,\\nbut Meg knew that she had done and said a thing which would not be\\nforgotten soon, although he might never allude to it again.  She had\\npromised to love him for better or worse, and then she, his wife, had\\nreproached him with his poverty, after spending his earnings\\nrecklessly.  It was dreadful, and the worst of it was John went on so\\nquietly afterward, just as if nothing had happened, except that he\\nstayed in town later, and worked at night when she had gone to cry\\nherself to sleep.  A week of remorse nearly made Meg sick, and the\\ndiscovery that John had countermanded the order for his new greatcoat\\nreduced her to a state of despair which was pathetic to behold.  He had\\nsimply said, in answer to her surprised inquiries as to the change, \"I\\ncan\\'t afford it, my dear.\"\\n\\nMeg said no more, but a few minutes after he found her in the hall with\\nher face buried in the old greatcoat, crying as if her heart would\\nbreak.\\n\\nThey had a long talk that night, and Meg learned to love her husband\\nbetter for his poverty, because it seemed to have made a man of him,\\ngiven him the strength and courage to fight his own way, and taught him\\na tender patience with which to bear and comfort the natural longings\\nand failures of those he loved.\\n\\nNext day she put her pride in her pocket, went to Sallie, told the\\ntruth, and asked her to buy the silk as a favor.  The good-natured Mrs.\\nMoffat willingly did so, and had the delicacy not to make her a present\\nof it immediately afterward.  Then Meg ordered home the greatcoat, and\\nwhen John arrived, she put it on, and asked him how he liked her new\\nsilk gown.  One can imagine what answer he made, how he received his\\npresent, and what a blissful state of things ensued.  John came home\\nearly, Meg gadded no more, and that greatcoat was put on in the morning\\nby a very happy husband, and taken off at night by a most devoted\\nlittle wife.  So the year rolled round, and at midsummer there came to\\nMeg a new experience, the deepest and tenderest of a woman\\'s life.\\n\\nLaurie came sneaking into the kitchen of the Dovecote one Saturday,\\nwith an excited face, and was received with the clash of cymbals, for\\nHannah clapped her hands with a saucepan in one and the cover in the\\nother.\\n\\n\"How\\'s the little mamma?  Where is everybody?  Why didn\\'t you tell me\\nbefore I came home?\" began Laurie in a loud whisper.\\n\\n\"Happy as a queen, the dear!  Every soul of \\'em is upstairs a\\nworshipin\\'.  We didn\\'t want no hurrycanes round.  Now you go into the\\nparlor, and I\\'ll send \\'em down to you,\" with which somewhat involved\\nreply Hannah vanished, chuckling ecstatically.\\n\\nPresently Jo appeared, proudly bearing a flannel bundle laid forth upon\\na large pillow.  Jo\\'s face was very sober, but her eyes twinkled, and\\nthere was an odd sound in her voice of repressed emotion of some sort.\\n\\n\"Shut your eyes and hold out your arms,\" she said invitingly.\\n\\nLaurie backed precipitately into a corner, and put his hands behind him\\nwith an imploring gesture.  \"No, thank you.  I\\'d rather not.  I shall\\ndrop it or smash it, as sure as fate.\"\\n\\n\"Then you shan\\'t see your nevvy,\" said Jo decidedly, turning as if to\\ngo.\\n\\n\"I will, I will!  Only you must be responsible for damages.\" and\\nobeying orders, Laurie heroically shut his eyes while something was put\\ninto his arms.  A peal of laughter from Jo, Amy, Mrs. March, Hannah,\\nand John caused him to open them the next minute, to find himself\\ninvested with two babies instead of one.\\n\\nNo wonder they laughed, for the expression of his face was droll enough\\nto convulse a Quaker, as he stood and stared wildly from the\\nunconscious innocents to the hilarious spectators with such dismay that\\nJo sat down on the floor and screamed.\\n\\n\"Twins, by Jupiter!\" was all he said for a minute, then turning to the\\nwomen with an appealing look that was comically piteous, he added,\\n\"Take \\'em quick, somebody!  I\\'m going to laugh, and I shall drop \\'em.\"\\n\\nJo rescued his babies, and marched up and down, with one on each arm,\\nas if already initiated into the mysteries of babytending, while Laurie\\nlaughed till the tears ran down his cheeks.\\n\\n\"It\\'s the best joke of the season, isn\\'t it?  I wouldn\\'t have told you,\\nfor I set my heart on surprising you, and I flatter myself I\\'ve done\\nit,\" said Jo, when she got her breath.\\n\\n\"I never was more staggered in my life.  Isn\\'t it fun?  Are they boys?\\nWhat are you going to name them? Let\\'s have another look.  Hold me up,\\nJo, for upon my life it\\'s one too many for me,\" returned Laurie,\\nregarding the infants with the air of a big, benevolent Newfoundland\\nlooking at a pair of infantile kittens.\\n\\n\"Boy and girl.  Aren\\'t they beauties?\" said the proud papa, beaming\\nupon the little red squirmers as if they were unfledged angels.\\n\\n\"Most remarkable children I ever saw.  Which is which?\" and Laurie bent\\nlike a well-sweep to examine the prodigies.\\n\\n\"Amy put a blue ribbon on the boy and a pink on the girl, French\\nfashion, so you can always tell.  Besides, one has blue eyes and one\\nbrown.  Kiss them, Uncle Teddy,\" said wicked Jo.\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid they mightn\\'t like it,\" began Laurie, with unusual timidity\\nin such matters.\\n\\n\"Of course they will, they are used to it now.  Do it this minute,\\nsir!\" commanded Jo, fearing he might propose a proxy.\\n\\nLaurie screwed up his face and obeyed with a gingerly peck at each\\nlittle cheek that produced another laugh, and made the babies squeal.\\n\\n\"There, I knew they didn\\'t like it!  That\\'s the boy, see him kick, he\\nhits out with his fists like a good one.  Now then, young Brooke, pitch\\ninto a man of your own size, will you?\" cried Laurie, delighted with a\\npoke in the face from a tiny fist, flapping aimlessly about.\\n\\n\"He\\'s to be named John Laurence, and the girl Margaret, after mother\\nand grandmother.  We shall call her Daisey, so as not to have two Megs,\\nand I suppose the mannie will be Jack, unless we find a better name,\"\\nsaid Amy, with aunt-like interest.\\n\\n\"Name him Demijohn, and call him Demi for short,\" said Laurie.\\n\\n\"Daisy and Demi, just the thing!  I knew Teddy would do it,\" cried Jo\\nclapping her hands.\\n\\nTeddy certainly had done it that time, for the babies were \\'Daisy\\' and\\n\\'Demi\\' to the end of the chapter.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'TWENTY-NINE\\n\\nCALLS\\n\\n\"Come, Jo, it\\'s time.\"\\n\\n\"For what?\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t mean to say you have forgotten that you promised to make\\nhalf a dozen calls with me today?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve done a good many rash and foolish things in my life, but I don\\'t\\nthink I ever was mad enough to say I\\'d make six calls in one day, when\\na single one upsets me for a week.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, you did, it was a bargain between us.  I was to finish the crayon\\nof Beth for you, and you were to go properly with me, and return our\\nneighbors\\' visits.\"\\n\\n\"If it was fair, that was in the bond, and I stand to the letter of my\\nbond, Shylock.  There is a pile of clouds in the east, it\\'s not fair,\\nand I don\\'t go.\"\\n\\n\"Now, that\\'s shirking.  It\\'s a lovely day, no prospect of rain, and you\\npride yourself on keeping promises, so be honorable, come and do your\\nduty, and then be at peace for another six months.\"\\n\\nAt that minute Jo was particularly absorbed in dressmaking, for she was\\nmantua-maker general to the family, and took especial credit to herself\\nbecause she could use a needle as well as a pen. It was very provoking\\nto be arrested in the act of a first trying-on, and ordered out to make\\ncalls in her best array on a warm July day. She hated calls of the\\nformal sort, and never made any till Amy compelled her with a bargain,\\nbribe, or promise.  In the present instance there was no escape, and\\nhaving clashed her scissors rebelliously, while protesting that she\\nsmelled thunder, she gave in, put away her work, and taking up her hat\\nand gloves with an air of resignation, told Amy the victim was ready.\\n\\n\"Jo March, you are perverse enough to provoke a saint!  You don\\'t\\nintend to make calls in that state, I hope,\" cried Amy, surveying her\\nwith amazement.\\n\\n\"Why not?  I\\'m neat and cool and comfortable, quite proper for a dusty\\nwalk on a warm day.  If people care more for my clothes than they do\\nfor me, I don\\'t wish to see them.  You can dress for both, and be as\\nelegant as you please.  It pays for you to be fine.  It doesn\\'t for me,\\nand furbelows only worry me.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, dear!\" sighed Amy, \"now she\\'s in a contrary fit, and will drive me\\ndistracted before I can get her properly ready. I\\'m sure it\\'s no\\npleasure to me to go today, but it\\'s a debt we owe society, and there\\'s\\nno one to pay it but you and me.  I\\'ll do anything for you, Jo, if\\nyou\\'ll only dress yourself nicely, and come and help me do the civil.\\nYou can talk so well, look so aristocratic in your best things, and\\nbehave so beautifully, if you try, that I\\'m proud of you.  I\\'m afraid\\nto go alone, do come and take care of me.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re an artful little puss to flatter and wheedle your cross old\\nsister in that way.  The idea of my being aristocratic and well-bred,\\nand your being afraid to go anywhere alone!  I don\\'t know which is the\\nmost absurd.  Well, I\\'ll go if I must, and do my best.  You shall be\\ncommander of the expedition, and I\\'ll obey blindly, will that satisfy\\nyou?\" said Jo, with a sudden change from perversity to lamblike\\nsubmission.\\n\\n\"You\\'re a perfect cherub!  Now put on all your best things, and I\\'ll\\ntell you how to behave at each place, so that you will make a good\\nimpression.  I want people to like you, and they would if you\\'d only\\ntry to be a little more agreeable.  Do your hair the pretty way, and\\nput the pink rose in your bonnet.  It\\'s becoming, and you look too\\nsober in your plain suit.  Take your light gloves and the embroidered\\nhandkerchief.  We\\'ll stop at Meg\\'s, and borrow her white sunshade, and\\nthen you can have my dove-colored one.\"\\n\\nWhile Amy dressed, she issued her orders, and Jo obeyed them, not\\nwithout entering her protest, however, for she sighed as she rustled\\ninto her new organdie, frowned darkly at herself as she tied her bonnet\\nstrings in an irreproachable bow, wrestled viciously with pins as she\\nput on her collar, wrinkled up her features generally as she shook out\\nthe handkerchief, whose embroidery was as irritating to her nose as the\\npresent mission was to her feelings, and when she had squeezed her\\nhands into tight gloves with three buttons and a tassel, as the last\\ntouch of elegance, she turned to Amy with an imbecile expression of\\ncountenance, saying meekly...\\n\\n\"I\\'m perfectly miserable, but if you consider me presentable, I die\\nhappy.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re highly satisfactory.  Turn slowly round, and let me get a\\ncareful view.\" Jo revolved, and Amy gave a touch here and there, then\\nfell back, with her head on one side, observing graciously, \"Yes,\\nyou\\'ll do.  Your head is all I could ask, for that white bonnet with\\nthe rose is quite ravishing.  Hold back your shoulders, and carry your\\nhands easily, no matter if your gloves do pinch.  There\\'s one thing you\\ncan do well, Jo, that is, wear a shawl.  I can\\'t, but it\\'s very nice to\\nsee you, and I\\'m so glad Aunt March gave you that lovely one.  It\\'s\\nsimple, but handsome, and those folds over the arm are really artistic.\\nIs the point of my mantle in the middle, and have I looped my dress\\nevenly? I like to show my boots, for my feet are pretty, though my nose\\nisn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"You are a thing of beauty and a joy forever,\" said Jo, looking through\\nher hand with the air of a connoisseur at the blue feather against the\\ngolden hair.  \"Am I to drag my best dress through the dust, or loop it\\nup, please, ma\\'am?\"\\n\\n\"Hold it up when you walk, but drop it in the house.  The sweeping\\nstyle suits you best, and you must learn to trail your skirts\\ngracefully.  You haven\\'t half buttoned one cuff, do it at once.  You\\'ll\\nnever look finished if you are not careful about the little details,\\nfor they make up the pleasing whole.\"\\n\\nJo sighed, and proceeded to burst the buttons off her glove, in doing\\nup her cuff, but at last both were ready, and sailed away, looking as\\n\\'pretty as picters\\', Hannah said, as she hung out of the upper window\\nto watch them.\\n\\n\"Now, Jo dear, the Chesters consider themselves very elegant people, so\\nI want you to put on your best deportment.  Don\\'t make any of your\\nabrupt remarks, or do anything odd, will you?  Just be calm, cool, and\\nquiet, that\\'s safe and ladylike, and you can easily do it for fifteen\\nminutes,\" said Amy, as they approached the first place, having borrowed\\nthe white parasol and been inspected by Meg, with a baby on each arm.\\n\\n\"Let me see.  \\'Calm, cool, and quiet\\', yes, I think I can promise that.\\nI\\'ve played the part of a prim young lady on the stage, and I\\'ll try it\\noff.  My powers are great, as you shall see, so be easy in your mind,\\nmy child.\"\\n\\nAmy looked relieved, but naughty Jo took her at her word, for during\\nthe first call she sat with every limb gracefully composed, every fold\\ncorrectly draped, calm as a summer sea, cool as a snowbank, and as\\nsilent as the sphinx.  In vain Mrs. Chester alluded to her \\'charming\\nnovel\\', and the Misses Chester introduced parties, picnics, the opera,\\nand the fashions.  Each and all were answered by a smile, a bow, and a\\ndemure \"Yes\" or \"No\" with the chill on.  In vain Amy telegraphed the\\nword \\'talk\\', tried to draw her out, and administered covert pokes with\\nher foot.  Jo sat as if blandly unconscious of it all, with deportment\\nlike Maud\\'s face, \\'icily regular, splendidly null\\'.\\n\\n\"What a haughty, uninteresting creature that oldest Miss March is!\" was\\nthe unfortunately audible remark of one of the ladies, as the door\\nclosed upon their guests.  Jo laughed noiselessly all through the hall,\\nbut Amy looked disgusted at the failure of her instructions, and very\\nnaturally laid the blame upon Jo.\\n\\n\"How could you mistake me so?  I merely meant you to be properly\\ndignified and composed, and you made yourself a perfect stock and\\nstone.  Try to be sociable at the Lambs\\'.  Gossip as other girls do,\\nand be interested in dress and flirtations and whatever nonsense comes\\nup.  They move in the best society, are valuable persons for us to\\nknow, and I wouldn\\'t fail to make a good impression there for anything.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll be agreeable.  I\\'ll gossip and giggle, and have horrors and\\nraptures over any trifle you like.  I rather enjoy this, and now I\\'ll\\nimitate what is called \\'a charming girl\\'.  I can do it, for I have May\\nChester as a model, and I\\'ll improve upon her.  See if the Lambs don\\'t\\nsay, \\'What a lively, nice creature that Jo March is!\"\\n\\nAmy felt anxious, as well she might, for when Jo turned freakish there\\nwas no knowing where she would stop.  Amy\\'s face was a study when she\\nsaw her sister skim into the next drawing room, kiss all the young\\nladies with effusion, beam graciously upon the young gentlemen, and\\njoin in the chat with a spirit which amazed the beholder. Amy was taken\\npossession of by Mrs. Lamb, with whom she was a favorite, and forced to\\nhear a long account of Lucretia\\'s last attack, while three delightful\\nyoung gentlemen hovered near, waiting for a pause when they might rush\\nin and rescue her.  So situated, she was powerless to check Jo, who\\nseemed possessed by a spirit of mischief, and talked away as volubly as\\nthe lady.  A knot of heads gathered about her, and Amy strained her\\nears to hear what was going on, for broken sentences filled her with\\ncuriosity, and frequent peals of laughter made her wild to share the\\nfun.  One may imagine her suffering on overhearing fragments of this\\nsort of conversation.\\n\\n\"She rides splendidly.  Who taught her?\"\\n\\n\"No one.  She used to practice mounting, holding the reins, and sitting\\nstraight on an old saddle in a tree.  Now she rides anything, for she\\ndoesn\\'t know what fear is, and the stableman lets her have horses cheap\\nbecause she trains them to carry ladies so well.  She has such a\\npassion for it, I often tell her if everything else fails, she can be a\\nhorsebreaker, and get her living so.\"\\n\\nAt this awful speech Amy contained herself with difficulty, for the\\nimpression was being given that she was rather a fast young lady, which\\nwas her especial aversion.  But what could she do?  For the old lady\\nwas in the middle of her story, and long before it was done, Jo was off\\nagain, making more droll revelations and committing still more fearful\\nblunders.\\n\\n\"Yes, Amy was in despair that day, for all the good beasts were gone,\\nand of three left, one was lame, one blind, and the other so balky that\\nyou had to put dirt in his mouth before he would start. Nice animal for\\na pleasure party, wasn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"Which did she choose?\" asked one of the laughing gentlemen, who\\nenjoyed the subject.\\n\\n\"None of them.  She heard of a young horse at the farm house over the\\nriver, and though a lady had never ridden him, she resolved to try,\\nbecause he was handsome and spirited.  Her struggles were really\\npathetic.  There was no one to bring the horse to the saddle, so she\\ntook the saddle to the horse.  My dear creature, she actually rowed it\\nover the river, put it on her head, and marched up to the barn to the\\nutter amazement of the old man!\"\\n\\n\"Did she ride the horse?\"\\n\\n\"Of course she did, and had a capital time.  I expected to see her\\nbrought home in fragments, but she managed him perfectly, and was the\\nlife of the party.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I call that plucky!\" and young Mr. Lamb turned an approving\\nglance upon Amy, wondering what his mother could be saying to make the\\ngirl look so red and uncomfortable.\\n\\nShe was still redder and more uncomfortable a moment after, when a\\nsudden turn in the conversation introduced the subject of dress.  One\\nof the young ladies asked Jo where she got the pretty drab hat she wore\\nto the picnic and stupid Jo, instead of mentioning the place where it\\nwas bought two years ago, must needs answer with unnecessary frankness,\\n\"Oh, Amy painted it.  You can\\'t buy those soft shades, so we paint ours\\nany color we like.  It\\'s a great comfort to have an artistic sister.\"\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t that an original idea?\" cried Miss Lamb, who found Jo great fun.\\n\\n\"That\\'s nothing compared to some of her brilliant performances. There\\'s\\nnothing the child can\\'t do.  Why, she wanted a pair of blue boots for\\nSallie\\'s party, so she just painted her soiled white ones the loveliest\\nshade of sky blue you ever saw, and they looked exactly like satin,\"\\nadded Jo, with an air of pride in her sister\\'s accomplishments that\\nexasperated Amy till she felt that it would be a relief to throw her\\ncardcase at her.\\n\\n\"We read a story of yours the other day, and enjoyed it very much,\"\\nobserved the elder Miss Lamb, wishing to compliment the literary lady,\\nwho did not look the character just then, it must be confessed.\\n\\nAny mention of her \\'works\\' always had a bad effect upon Jo, who either\\ngrew rigid and looked offended, or changed the subject with a brusque\\nremark, as now.  \"Sorry you could find nothing better to read.  I write\\nthat rubbish because it sells, and ordinary people like it.  Are you\\ngoing to New York this winter?\"\\n\\nAs Miss Lamb had \\'enjoyed\\' the story, this speech was not exactly\\ngrateful or complimentary.  The minute it was made Jo saw her mistake,\\nbut fearing to make the matter worse, suddenly remembered that it was\\nfor her to make the first move toward departure, and did so with an\\nabruptness that left three people with half-finished sentences in their\\nmouths.\\n\\n\"Amy, we must go.  Good-by, dear, do come and see us.  We are pining\\nfor a visit.  I don\\'t dare to ask you, Mr. Lamb, but if you should\\ncome, I don\\'t think I shall have the heart to send you away.\"\\n\\nJo said this with such a droll imitation of May Chester\\'s gushing style\\nthat Amy got out of the room as rapidly as possible, feeling a strong\\ndesire to laugh and cry at the same time.\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t I do well?\" asked Jo, with a satisfied air as they walked away.\\n\\n\"Nothing could have been worse,\" was Amy\\'s crushing reply. \"What\\npossessed you to tell those stories about my saddle, and the hats and\\nboots, and all the rest of it?\"\\n\\n\"Why, it\\'s funny, and amuses people.  They know we are poor, so it\\'s no\\nuse pretending that we have grooms, buy three or four hats a season,\\nand have things as easy and fine as they do.\"\\n\\n\"You needn\\'t go and tell them all our little shifts, and expose our\\npoverty in that perfectly unnecessary way.  You haven\\'t a bit of proper\\npride, and never will learn when to hold your tongue and when to\\nspeak,\" said Amy despairingly.\\n\\nPoor Jo looked abashed, and silently chafed the end of her nose with\\nthe stiff handkerchief, as if performing a penance for her misdemeanors.\\n\\n\"How shall I behave here?\" she asked, as they approached the third\\nmansion.\\n\\n\"Just as you please.  I wash my hands of you,\" was Amy\\'s short answer.\\n\\n\"Then I\\'ll enjoy myself.  The boys are at home, and we\\'ll have a\\ncomfortable time.  Goodness knows I need a little change, for elegance\\nhas a bad effect upon my constitution,\" returned Jo gruffly, being\\ndisturbed by her failure to suit.\\n\\nAn enthusiastic welcome from three big boys and several pretty children\\nspeedily soothed her ruffled feelings, and leaving Amy to entertain the\\nhostess and Mr. Tudor, who happened to be calling likewise, Jo devoted\\nherself to the young folks and found the change refreshing.  She\\nlistened to college stories with deep interest, caressed pointers and\\npoodles without a murmur, agreed heartily that \"Tom Brown was a brick,\"\\nregardless of the improper form of praise, and when one lad proposed a\\nvisit to his turtle tank, she went with an alacrity which caused Mamma\\nto smile upon her, as that motherly lady settled the cap which was left\\nin a ruinous condition by filial hugs, bearlike but affectionate, and\\ndearer to her than the most faultless coiffure from the hands of an\\ninspired Frenchwoman.\\n\\nLeaving her sister to her own devices, Amy proceeded to enjoy herself\\nto her heart\\'s content.  Mr. Tudor\\'s uncle had married an English lady\\nwho was third cousin to a living lord, and Amy regarded the whole\\nfamily with great respect, for in spite of her American birth and\\nbreeding, she possessed that reverence for titles which haunts the best\\nof us--that unacknowledged loyalty to the early faith in kings which\\nset the most democratic nation under the sun in ferment at the coming\\nof a royal yellow-haired laddie, some years ago, and which still has\\nsomething to do with the love the young country bears the old, like\\nthat of a big son for an imperious little mother, who held him while\\nshe could, and let him go with a farewell scolding when he rebelled.\\nBut even the satisfaction of talking with a distant connection of the\\nBritish nobility did not render Amy forgetful of time, and when the\\nproper number of minutes had passed, she reluctantly tore herself from\\nthis aristocratic society, and looked about for Jo, fervently hoping\\nthat her incorrigible sister would not be found in any position which\\nshould bring disgrace upon the name of March.\\n\\nIt might have been worse, but Amy considered it bad.  For Jo sat on the\\ngrass, with an encampment of boys about her, and a dirty-footed dog\\nreposing on the skirt of her state and festival dress, as she related\\none of Laurie\\'s pranks to her admiring audience.  One small child was\\npoking turtles with Amy\\'s cherished parasol, a second was eating\\ngingerbread over Jo\\'s best bonnet, and a third playing ball with her\\ngloves, but all were enjoying themselves, and when Jo collected her\\ndamaged property to go, her escort accompanied her, begging her to come\\nagain, \"It was such fun to hear about Laurie\\'s larks.\"\\n\\n\"Capital boys, aren\\'t they?  I feel quite young and brisk again after\\nthat.\" said Jo, strolling along with her hands behind her, partly from\\nhabit, partly to conceal the bespattered parasol.\\n\\n\"Why do you always avoid Mr. Tudor?\" asked Amy, wisely refraining from\\nany comment upon Jo\\'s dilapidated appearance.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t like him, he puts on airs, snubs his sisters, worries his\\nfather, and doesn\\'t speak respectfully of his mother.  Laurie says he\\nis fast, and I don\\'t consider him a desirable acquaintance, so I let\\nhim alone.\"\\n\\n\"You might treat him civilly, at least.  You gave him a cool nod, and\\njust now you bowed and smiled in the politest way to Tommy Chamberlain,\\nwhose father keeps a grocery store.  If you had just reversed the nod\\nand the bow, it would have been right,\" said Amy reprovingly.\\n\\n\"No, it wouldn\\'t,\" returned Jo, \"I neither like, respect, nor admire\\nTudor, though his grandfather\\'s uncle\\'s nephew\\'s niece was a third\\ncousin to a lord.  Tommy is poor and bashful and good and very clever.\\nI think well of him, and like to show that I do, for he is a gentleman\\nin spite of the brown paper parcels.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s no use trying to argue with you,\" began Amy.\\n\\n\"Not the least, my dear,\" interrupted Jo, \"so let us look amiable, and\\ndrop a card here, as the Kings are evidently out, for which I\\'m deeply\\ngrateful.\"\\n\\nThe family cardcase having done its duty the girls walked on, and Jo\\nuttered another thanksgiving on reaching the fifth house, and being\\ntold that the young ladies were engaged.\\n\\n\"Now let us go home, and never mind Aunt March today.  We can run down\\nthere any time, and it\\'s really a pity to trail through the dust in our\\nbest bibs and tuckers, when we are tired and cross.\"\\n\\n\"Speak for yourself, if you please.  Aunt March likes to have us pay\\nher the compliment of coming in style, and making a formal call. It\\'s a\\nlittle thing to do, but it gives her pleasure, and I don\\'t believe it\\nwill hurt your things half so much as letting dirty dogs and clumping\\nboys spoil them.  Stoop down, and let me take the crumbs off of your\\nbonnet.\"\\n\\n\"What a good girl you are, Amy!\" said Jo, with a repentant glance from\\nher own damaged costume to that of her sister, which was fresh and\\nspotless still.  \"I wish it was as easy for me to do little things to\\nplease people as it is for you.  I think of them, but it takes too much\\ntime to do them, so I wait for a chance to confer a great favor, and\\nlet the small ones slip, but they tell best in the end, I fancy.\"\\n\\nAmy smiled and was mollified at once, saying with a maternal air,\\n\"Women should learn to be agreeable, particularly poor ones, for they\\nhave no other way of repaying the kindnesses they receive. If you\\'d\\nremember that, and practice it, you\\'d be better liked than I am,\\nbecause there is more of you.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m a crotchety old thing, and always shall be, but I\\'m willing to own\\nthat you are right, only it\\'s easier for me to risk my life for a\\nperson than to be pleasant to him when I don\\'t feel like it.  It\\'s a\\ngreat misfortune to have such strong likes and dislikes, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a greater not to be able to hide them.  I don\\'t mind saying that\\nI don\\'t approve of Tudor any more than you do, but I\\'m not called upon\\nto tell him so.  Neither are you, and there is no use in making\\nyourself disagreeable because he is.\"\\n\\n\"But I think girls ought to show when they disapprove of young men, and\\nhow can they do it except by their manners? Preaching does not do any\\ngood, as I know to my sorrow, since I\\'ve had Teddie to manage.  But\\nthere are many little ways in which I can influence him without a word,\\nand I say we ought to do it to others if we can.\"\\n\\n\"Teddy is a remarkable boy, and can\\'t be taken as a sample of other\\nboys,\" said Amy, in a tone of solemn conviction, which would have\\nconvulsed the \\'remarkable boy\\' if he had heard it.  \"If we were belles,\\nor women of wealth and position, we might do something, perhaps, but\\nfor us to frown at one set of young gentlemen because we don\\'t approve\\nof them, and smile upon another set because we do, wouldn\\'t have a\\nparticle of effect, and we should only be considered odd and\\npuritanical.\"\\n\\n\"So we are to countenance things and people which we detest, merely\\nbecause we are not belles and millionaires, are we? That\\'s a nice sort\\nof morality.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t argue about it, I only know that it\\'s the way of the world,\\nand people who set themselves against it only get laughed at for their\\npains.  I don\\'t like reformers, and I hope you never try to be one.\"\\n\\n\"I do like them, and I shall be one if I can, for in spite of the\\nlaughing the world would never get on without them.  We can\\'t agree\\nabout that, for you belong to the old set, and I to the new. You will\\nget on the best, but I shall have the liveliest time of it. I should\\nrather enjoy the brickbats and hooting, I think.\"\\n\\n\"Well, compose yourself now, and don\\'t worry Aunt with your new ideas.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll try not to, but I\\'m always possessed to burst out with some\\nparticularly blunt speech or revolutionary sentiment before her.  It\\'s\\nmy doom, and I can\\'t help it.\"\\n\\nThey found Aunt Carrol with the old lady, both absorbed in some very\\ninteresting subject, but they dropped it as the girls came in, with a\\nconscious look which betrayed that they had been talking about their\\nnieces.  Jo was not in a good humor, and the perverse fit returned, but\\nAmy, who had virtuously done her duty, kept her temper and pleased\\neverybody, was in a most angelic frame of mind.  This amiable spirit\\nwas felt at once, and both aunts \\'my deared\\' her affectionately,\\nlooking what they afterward said emphatically, \"That child improves\\nevery day.\"\\n\\n\"Are you going to help about the fair, dear?\" asked Mrs. Carrol, as Amy\\nsat down beside her with the confiding air elderly people like so well\\nin the young.\\n\\n\"Yes, Aunt.  Mrs. Chester asked me if I would, and I offered to tend a\\ntable, as I have nothing but my time to give.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not,\" put in Jo decidedly.  \"I hate to be patronized, and the\\nChesters think it\\'s a great favor to allow us to help with their highly\\nconnected fair.  I wonder you consented, Amy, they only want you to\\nwork.\"\\n\\n\"I am willing to work.  It\\'s for the freedmen as well as the Chesters,\\nand I think it very kind of them to let me share the labor and the fun.\\nPatronage does not trouble me when it is well meant.\"\\n\\n\"Quite right and proper.  I like your grateful spirit, my dear. It\\'s a\\npleasure to help people who appreciate our efforts.  Some do not, and\\nthat is trying,\" observed Aunt March, looking over her spectacles at\\nJo, who sat apart, rocking herself, with a somewhat morose expression.\\n\\nIf Jo had only known what a great happiness was wavering in the balance\\nfor one of them, she would have turned dove-like in a minute, but\\nunfortunately, we don\\'t have windows in our breasts, and cannot see\\nwhat goes on in the minds of our friends.  Better for us that we cannot\\nas a general thing, but now and then it would be such a comfort, such a\\nsaving of time and temper.  By her next speech, Jo deprived herself of\\nseveral years of pleasure, and received a timely lesson in the art of\\nholding her tongue.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t like favors, they oppress and make me feel like a slave.  I\\'d\\nrather do everything for myself, and be perfectly independent.\"\\n\\n\"Ahem!\" coughed Aunt Carrol softly, with a look at Aunt March.\\n\\n\"I told you so,\" said Aunt March, with a decided nod to Aunt Carrol.\\n\\nMercifully unconscious of what she had done, Jo sat with her nose in\\nthe air, and a revolutionary aspect which was anything but inviting.\\n\\n\"Do you speak French, dear?\" asked Mrs. Carrol, laying a hand on Amy\\'s.\\n\\n\"Pretty well, thanks to Aunt March, who lets Esther talk to me as often\\nas I like,\" replied Amy, with a grateful look, which caused the old\\nlady to smile affably.\\n\\n\"How are you about languages?\" asked Mrs. Carrol of Jo.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t know a word.  I\\'m very stupid about studying anything, can\\'t\\nbear French, it\\'s such a slippery, silly sort of language,\" was the\\nbrusque reply.\\n\\nAnother look passed between the ladies, and Aunt March said to Amy,\\n\"You are quite strong and well now, dear, I believe?  Eyes don\\'t\\ntrouble you any more, do they?\"\\n\\n\"Not at all, thank you, ma\\'am.  I\\'m very well, and mean to do great\\nthings next winter, so that I may be ready for Rome, whenever that\\njoyful time arrives.\"\\n\\n\"Good girl!  You deserve to go, and I\\'m sure you will some day,\" said\\nAunt March, with an approving pat on the head, as Amy picked up her\\nball for her.\\n\\n    Crosspatch, draw the latch,\\n    Sit by the fire and spin,\\n\\nsqualled Polly, bending down from his perch on the back of her chair to\\npeep into Jo\\'s face, with such a comical air of impertinent inquiry\\nthat it was impossible to help laughing.\\n\\n\"Most observing bird,\" said the old lady.\\n\\n\"Come and take a walk, my dear?\" cried Polly, hopping toward the china\\ncloset, with a look suggestive of a lump of sugar.\\n\\n\"Thank you, I will.  Come Amy.\" and Jo brought the visit to an end,\\nfeeling more strongly than ever that calls did have a bad effect upon\\nher constitution.  She shook hands in a gentlemanly manner, but Amy\\nkissed both the aunts, and the girls departed, leaving behind them the\\nimpression of shadow and sunshine, which impression caused Aunt March\\nto say, as they vanished...\\n\\n\"You\\'d better do it, Mary.  I\\'ll supply the money.\" and Aunt Carrol to\\nreply decidedly, \"I certainly will, if her father and mother consent.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'THIRTY\\n\\nCONSEQUENCES\\n\\nMrs. Chester\\'s fair was so very elegant and select that it was\\nconsidered a great honor by the young ladies of the neighborhood to be\\ninvited to take a table, and everyone was much interested in the\\nmatter.  Amy was asked, but Jo was not, which was fortunate for all\\nparties, as her elbows were decidedly akimbo at this period of her\\nlife, and it took a good many hard knocks to teach her how to get on\\neasily.  The \\'haughty, uninteresting creature\\' was let severely alone,\\nbut Amy\\'s talent and taste were duly complimented by the offer of the\\nart table, and she exerted herself to prepare and secure appropriate\\nand valuable contributions to it.\\n\\nEverything went on smoothly till the day before the fair opened, then\\nthere occurred one of the little skirmishes which it is almost\\nimpossible to avoid, when some five-and-twenty women, old and young,\\nwith all their private piques and prejudices, try to work together.\\n\\nMay Chester was rather jealous of Amy because the latter was a greater\\nfavorite than herself, and just at this time several trifling\\ncircumstances occurred to increase the feeling.  Amy\\'s dainty\\npen-and-ink work entirely eclipsed May\\'s painted vases--that was one\\nthorn.  Then the all conquering Tudor had danced four times with Amy at\\na late party and only once with May--that was thorn number two.  But\\nthe chief grievance that rankled in her soul, and gave an excuse for\\nher unfriendly conduct, was a rumor which some obliging gossip had\\nwhispered to her, that the March girls had made fun of her at the\\nLambs\\'. All the blame of this should have fallen upon Jo, for her\\nnaughty imitation had been too lifelike to escape detection, and the\\nfrolicsome Lambs had permitted the joke to escape.  No hint of this had\\nreached the culprits, however, and Amy\\'s dismay can be imagined, when,\\nthe very evening before the fair, as she was putting the last touches\\nto her pretty table, Mrs. Chester, who, of course, resented the\\nsupposed ridicule of her daughter, said, in a bland tone, but with a\\ncold look...\\n\\n\"I find, dear, that there is some feeling among the young ladies about\\nmy giving this table to anyone but my girls.  As this is the most\\nprominent, and some say the most attractive table of all, and they are\\nthe chief getters-up of the fair, it is thought best for them to take\\nthis place.  I\\'m sorry, but I know you are too sincerely interested in\\nthe cause to mind a little personal disappointment, and you shall have\\nanother table if you like.\"\\n\\nMrs. Chester fancied beforehand that it would be easy to deliver this\\nlittle speech, but when the time came, she found it rather difficult to\\nutter it naturally, with Amy\\'s unsuspicious eyes looking straight at\\nher full of surprise and trouble.\\n\\nAmy felt that there was something behind this, but could not guess\\nwhat, and said quietly, feeling hurt, and showing that she did,\\n\"Perhaps you had rather I took no table at all?\"\\n\\n\"Now, my dear, don\\'t have any ill feeling, I beg.  It\\'s merely a matter\\nof expediency, you see, my girls will naturally take the lead, and this\\ntable is considered their proper place.  I think it very appropriate to\\nyou, and feel very grateful for your efforts to make it so pretty, but\\nwe must give up our private wishes, of course, and I will see that you\\nhave a good place elsewhere. Wouldn\\'t you like the flower table? The\\nlittle girls undertook it, but they are discouraged.  You could make a\\ncharming thing of it, and the flower table is always attractive you\\nknow.\"\\n\\n\"Especially to gentlemen,\" added May, with a look which enlightened Amy\\nas to one cause of her sudden fall from favor.  She colored angrily,\\nbut took no other notice of that girlish sarcasm, and answered with\\nunexpected amiability...\\n\\n\"It shall be as you please, Mrs. Chester.  I\\'ll give up my place here\\nat once, and attend to the flowers, if you like.\"\\n\\n\"You can put your own things on your own table, if you prefer,\" began\\nMay, feeling a little conscience-stricken, as she looked at the pretty\\nracks, the painted shells, and quaint illuminations Amy had so\\ncarefully made and so gracefully arranged.  She meant it kindly, but\\nAmy mistook her meaning, and said quickly...\\n\\n\"Oh, certainly, if they are in your way,\" and sweeping her\\ncontributions into her apron, pell-mell, she walked off, feeling that\\nherself and her works of art had been insulted past forgiveness.\\n\\n\"Now she\\'s mad.  Oh, dear, I wish I hadn\\'t asked you to speak,  Mama,\"\\nsaid May, looking disconsolately at the empty spaces on her table.\\n\\n\"Girls\\' quarrels are soon over,\" returned her mother, feeling a trifle\\nashamed of her own part in this one, as well she might.\\n\\nThe little girls hailed Amy and her treasures with delight, which\\ncordial reception somewhat soothed her perturbed spirit, and she fell\\nto work, determined to succeed florally, if she could not artistically.\\nBut everything seemed against her.  It was late, and she was tired.\\nEveryone was too busy with their own affairs to help her, and the\\nlittle girls were only hindrances, for the dears fussed and chattered\\nlike so many magpies, making a great deal of confusion in their artless\\nefforts to preserve the most perfect order.  The evergreen arch\\nwouldn\\'t stay firm after she got it up, but wiggled and threatened to\\ntumble down on her head when the hanging baskets were filled.  Her best\\ntile got a splash of water, which left a sepia tear on the Cupid\\'s\\ncheek.  She bruised her hands with hammering, and got cold working in a\\ndraft, which last affliction filled her with apprehensions for the\\nmorrow.  Any girl reader who has suffered like afflictions will\\nsympathize with poor Amy and wish her well through her task.\\n\\nThere was great indignation at home when she told her story that\\nevening.  Her mother said it was a shame, but told her she had done\\nright.  Beth declared she wouldn\\'t go to the fair at all, and Jo\\ndemanded why she didn\\'t take all her pretty things and leave those mean\\npeople to get on without her.\\n\\n\"Because they are mean is no reason why I should be.  I hate such\\nthings, and though I think I\\'ve a right to be hurt, I don\\'t intend to\\nshow it.  They will feel that more than angry speeches or huffy\\nactions, won\\'t they, Marmee?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s the right spirit, my dear.  A kiss for a blow is always best,\\nthough it\\'s not very easy to give it sometimes,\" said her mother, with\\nthe air of one who had learned the difference between preaching and\\npracticing.\\n\\nIn spite of various very natural temptations to resent and retaliate,\\nAmy adhered to her resolution all the next day, bent on conquering her\\nenemy by kindness.  She began well, thanks to a silent reminder that\\ncame to her unexpectedly, but most opportunely. As she arranged her\\ntable that morning, while the little girls were in the anteroom filling\\nthe baskets, she took up her pet production, a little book, the antique\\ncover of which her father had found among his treasures, and in which\\non leaves of vellum she had beautifully illuminated different texts.\\nAs she turned the pages rich in dainty devices with very pardonable\\npride, her eye fell upon one verse that made her stop and think.\\nFramed in a brilliant scrollwork of scarlet, blue and gold, with little\\nspirits of good will helping one another up and down among the thorns\\nand flowers, were the words, \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\"\\n\\n\"I ought, but I don\\'t,\" thought Amy, as her eye went from the bright\\npage to May\\'s discontented face behind the big vases, that could not\\nhide the vacancies her pretty work had once filled.  Amy stood a\\nminute, turning the leaves in her hand, reading on each some sweet\\nrebuke for all heartburnings and uncharitableness of spirit. Many wise\\nand true sermons are preached us every day by unconscious ministers in\\nstreet, school, office, or home.  Even a fair table may become a\\npulpit, if it can offer the good and helpful words which are never out\\nof season.  Amy\\'s conscience preached her a little sermon from that\\ntext, then and there, and she did what many of us do not always do,\\ntook the sermon to heart, and straightway put it in practice.\\n\\nA group of girls were standing about May\\'s table, admiring the pretty\\nthings, and talking over the change of saleswomen.  They dropped their\\nvoices, but Amy knew they were speaking of her, hearing one side of the\\nstory and judging accordingly.  It was not pleasant, but a better\\nspirit had come over her, and presently a chance offered for proving\\nit.  She heard May say sorrowfully...\\n\\n\"It\\'s too bad, for there is no time to make other things, and I don\\'t\\nwant to fill up with odds and ends.  The table was just complete then.\\nNow it\\'s spoiled.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say she\\'d put them back if you asked her,\" suggested someone.\\n\\n\"How could I after all the fuss?\" began May, but she did not finish,\\nfor Amy\\'s voice came across the hall, saying pleasantly...\\n\\n\"You may have them, and welcome, without asking, if you want them.  I\\nwas just thinking I\\'d offer to put them back, for they belong to your\\ntable rather than mine.  Here they are, please take them, and forgive\\nme if I was hasty in carrying them away last night.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke, Amy returned her contribution, with a nod and a smile,\\nand hurried away again, feeling that it was easier to do a friendly\\nthing than it was to stay and be thanked for it.\\n\\n\"Now, I call that lovely of her, don\\'t you?\" cried one girl.\\n\\nMay\\'s answer was inaudible, but another young lady, whose temper was\\nevidently a little soured by making lemonade, added, with a\\ndisagreeable laugh, \"Very lovely, for she knew she wouldn\\'t sell them\\nat her own table.\"\\n\\nNow, that was hard.  When we make little sacrifices we like to have\\nthem appreciated, at least, and for a minute Amy was sorry she had done\\nit, feeling that virtue was not always its own reward. But it is, as\\nshe presently discovered, for her spirits began to rise, and her table\\nto blossom under her skillful hands, the girls were very kind, and that\\none little act seemed to have cleared the atmosphere amazingly.\\n\\nIt was a very long day and a hard one for Amy, as she sat behind her\\ntable, often quite alone, for the little girls deserted very soon.  Few\\ncared to buy flowers in summer, and her bouquets began to droop long\\nbefore night.\\n\\nThe art table was the most attractive in the room.  There was a crowd\\nabout it all day long, and the tenders were constantly flying to and\\nfro with important faces and rattling money boxes.  Amy often looked\\nwistfully across, longing to be there, where she felt at home and\\nhappy, instead of in a corner with nothing to do.  It might seem no\\nhardship to some of us, but to a pretty, blithe young girl, it was not\\nonly tedious, but very trying, and the thought of Laurie and his\\nfriends made it a real martyrdom.\\n\\nShe did not go home till night, and then she looked so pale and quiet\\nthat they knew the day had been a hard one, though she made no\\ncomplaint, and did not even tell what she had done.  Her mother gave\\nher an extra cordial cup of tea.  Beth helped her dress, and made a\\ncharming little wreath for her hair, while Jo astonished her family by\\ngetting herself up with unusual care, and hinting darkly that the\\ntables were about to be turned.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t do anything rude, pray Jo; I won\\'t have any fuss made, so let it\\nall pass and behave yourself,\" begged Amy, as she departed early,\\nhoping to find a reinforcement of flowers to refresh her poor little\\ntable.\\n\\n\"I merely intend to make myself entrancingly agreeable to every one I\\nknow, and to keep them in your corner as long as possible. Teddy and\\nhis boys will lend a hand, and we\\'ll have a good time yet.\" returned\\nJo, leaning over the gate to watch for Laurie.  Presently the familiar\\ntramp was heard in the dusk, and she ran out to meet him.\\n\\n\"Is that my boy?\"\\n\\n\"As sure as this is my girl!\" and Laurie tucked her hand under his arm\\nwith the air of a man whose every wish was gratified.\\n\\n\"Oh, Teddy, such doings!\" and Jo told Amy\\'s wrongs with sisterly zeal.\\n\\n\"A flock of our fellows are going to drive over by-and-by, and I\\'ll be\\nhanged if I don\\'t make them buy every flower she\\'s got, and camp down\\nbefore her table afterward,\" said Laurie, espousing her cause with\\nwarmth.\\n\\n\"The flowers are not at all nice, Amy says, and the fresh ones may not\\narrive in time.  I don\\'t wish to be unjust or suspicious, but I\\nshouldn\\'t wonder if they never came at all.  When people do one mean\\nthing they are very likely to do another,\" observed Jo in a disgusted\\ntone.\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t Hayes give you the best out of our gardens? I told him to.\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t know that, he forgot, I suppose, and, as your grandpa was\\npoorly, I didn\\'t like to worry him by asking, though I did want some.\"\\n\\n\"Now, Jo, how could you think there was any need of asking? They are\\njust as much yours as mine.  Don\\'t we always go halves in everything?\"\\nbegan Laurie, in the tone that always made Jo turn thorny.\\n\\n\"Gracious, I hope not!  Half of some of your things wouldn\\'t suit me at\\nall.  But we mustn\\'t stand philandering here.  I\\'ve got to help Amy, so\\nyou go and make yourself splendid, and if you\\'ll be so very kind as to\\nlet Hayes take a few nice flowers up to the Hall, I\\'ll bless you\\nforever.\"\\n\\n\"Couldn\\'t you do it now?\" asked Laurie, so suggestively that Jo shut\\nthe gate in his face with inhospitable haste, and called through the\\nbars, \"Go away, Teddy, I\\'m busy.\"\\n\\nThanks to the conspirators, the tables were turned that night, for\\nHayes sent up a wilderness of flowers, with a loverly basket arranged\\nin his best manner for a centerpiece.  Then the March family turned out\\nen masse, and Jo exerted herself to some purpose, for people not only\\ncame, but stayed, laughing at her nonsense, admiring Amy\\'s taste, and\\napparently enjoying themselves very much.  Laurie and his friends\\ngallantly threw themselves into the breach, bought up the bouquets,\\nencamped before the table, and made that corner the liveliest spot in\\nthe room.  Amy was in her element now, and out of gratitude, if nothing\\nmore, was as spritely and gracious as possible, coming to the\\nconclusion, about that time, that virtue was its own reward, after all.\\n\\nJo behaved herself with exemplary propriety, and when Amy was happily\\nsurrounded by her guard of honor, Jo circulated about the Hall, picking\\nup various bits of gossip, which enlightened her upon the subject of\\nthe Chester change of base.  She reproached herself for her share of\\nthe ill feeling and resolved to exonerate Amy as soon as possible.  She\\nalso discovered what Amy had done about the things in the morning, and\\nconsidered her a model of magnanimity.  As she passed the art table,\\nshe glanced over it for her sister\\'s things, but saw no sign of them.\\n\"Tucked away out of sight, I dare say,\" thought Jo, who could forgive\\nher own wrongs, but hotly resented any insult offered her family.\\n\\n\"Good evening, Miss Jo.  How does Amy get on?\" asked May with a\\nconciliatory air, for she wanted to show that she also could be\\ngenerous.\\n\\n\"She has sold everything she had that was worth selling, and now she is\\nenjoying herself.  The flower table is always attractive, you know,\\n\\'especially to gentlemen\\'.\" Jo couldn\\'t resist giving that little slap,\\nbut May took it so meekly she regretted it a minute after, and fell to\\npraising the great vases, which still remained unsold.\\n\\n\"Is Amy\\'s illumination anywhere about?  I took a fancy to buy that for\\nFather,\" said Jo, very anxious to learn the fate of her sister\\'s work.\\n\\n\"Everything of Amy\\'s sold long ago.  I took care that the right people\\nsaw them, and they made a nice little sum of money for us,\" returned\\nMay, who had overcome sundry small temptations, as well as Amy had,\\nthat day.\\n\\nMuch gratified, Jo rushed back to tell the good news, and Amy looked\\nboth touched and surprised by the report of May\\'s word and manner.\\n\\n\"Now, gentlemen, I want you to go and do your duty by the other tables\\nas generously as you have by mine, especially the art table,\" she said,\\nordering out \\'Teddy\\'s own\\', as the girls called the college friends.\\n\\n\"\\'Charge, Chester, charge!\\' is the motto for that table, but do your\\nduty like men, and you\\'ll get your money\\'s worth of art in every sense\\nof the word,\" said the irrepressible Jo, as the devoted phalanx\\nprepared to take the field.\\n\\n\"To hear is to obey, but March is fairer far than May,\" said little\\nParker, making a frantic effort to be both witty and tender, and\\ngetting promptly quenched by Laurie, who said...\\n\\n\"Very well, my son, for a small boy!\" and walked him off, with a\\npaternal pat on the head.\\n\\n\"Buy the vases,\" whispered Amy to Laurie, as a final heaping of coals\\nof fire on her enemy\\'s head.\\n\\nTo May\\'s great delight, Mr. Laurence not only bought the vases, but\\npervaded the hall with one under each arm.  The other gentlemen\\nspeculated with equal rashness in all sorts of frail trifles, and\\nwandered helplessly about afterward, burdened with wax flowers, painted\\nfans, filigree portfolios, and other useful and appropriate purchases.\\n\\nAunt Carrol was there, heard the story, looked pleased, and said\\nsomething to Mrs. March in a corner, which made the latter lady beam\\nwith satisfaction, and watch Amy with a face full of mingled pride and\\nanxiety, though she did not betray the cause of her pleasure till\\nseveral days later.\\n\\nThe fair was pronounced a success, and when May bade Amy goodnight, she\\ndid not gush as usual, but gave her an affectionate kiss, and a look\\nwhich said \\'forgive and forget\\'.  That satisfied Amy, and when she got\\nhome she found the vases paraded on the parlor chimney piece with a\\ngreat bouquet in each.  \"The reward of merit for a magnanimous March,\"\\nas Laurie announced with a flourish.\\n\\n\"You\\'ve a deal more principle and generosity and nobleness of character\\nthan I ever gave you credit for, Amy.  You\\'ve behaved sweetly, and I\\nrespect you with all my heart,\" said Jo warmly, as they brushed their\\nhair together late that night.\\n\\n\"Yes, we all do, and love her for being so ready to forgive.  It must\\nhave been dreadfully hard, after working so long and setting your heart\\non selling your own pretty things.  I don\\'t believe I could have done\\nit as kindly as you did,\" added Beth from her pillow.\\n\\n\"Why, girls, you needn\\'t praise me so.  I only did as I\\'d be done by.\\nYou laugh at me when I say I want to be a lady, but I mean a true\\ngentlewoman in mind and manners, and I try to do it as far as I know\\nhow.  I can\\'t explain exactly, but I want to be above the little\\nmeannesses and follies and faults that spoil so many women.  I\\'m far\\nfrom it now, but I do my best, and hope in time to be what Mother is.\"\\n\\nAmy spoke earnestly, and Jo said, with a cordial hug, \"I understand now\\nwhat you mean, and I\\'ll never laugh at you again. You are getting on\\nfaster than you think, and I\\'ll take lessons of you in true politeness,\\nfor you\\'ve learned the secret, I believe. Try away, deary, you\\'ll get\\nyour reward some day, and no one will be more delighted than I shall.\"\\n\\nA week later Amy did get her reward, and poor Jo found it hard to be\\ndelighted.  A letter came from Aunt Carrol, and Mrs. March\\'s face was\\nilluminated to such a degree when she read it that Jo and Beth, who\\nwere with her, demanded what the glad tidings were.\\n\\n\"Aunt Carrol is going abroad next month, and wants...\"\\n\\n\"Me to go with her!\" burst in Jo, flying out of her chair in an\\nuncontrollable rapture.\\n\\n\"No, dear, not you.  It\\'s Amy.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Mother!  She\\'s too young, it\\'s my turn first.  I\\'ve wanted it so\\nlong.  It would do me so much good, and be so altogether splendid.  I\\nmust go!\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid it\\'s impossible, Jo.  Aunt says Amy, decidedly, and it is\\nnot for us to dictate when she offers such a favor.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s always so.  Amy has all the fun and I have all the work. It isn\\'t\\nfair, oh, it isn\\'t fair!\" cried Jo passionately.\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid it\\'s partly your own fault, dear.  When Aunt spoke to me\\nthe other day, she regretted your blunt manners and too independent\\nspirit, and here she writes, as if quoting something you had said--\\'I\\nplanned at first to ask Jo, but as \\'favors burden her\\', and she \\'hates\\nFrench\\', I think I won\\'t venture to invite her.  Amy is more docile,\\nwill make a good companion for Flo, and receive gratefully any help the\\ntrip may give her.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, my tongue, my abominable tongue!  Why can\\'t I learn to keep it\\nquiet?\" groaned Jo, remembering words which had been her undoing.  When\\nshe had heard the explanation of the quoted phrases, Mrs. March said\\nsorrowfully...\\n\\n\"I wish you could have gone, but there is no hope of it this time, so\\ntry to bear it cheerfully, and don\\'t sadden Amy\\'s pleasure by\\nreproaches or regrets.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll try,\" said Jo, winking hard as she knelt down to pick up the\\nbasket she had joyfully upset.  \"I\\'ll take a leaf out of her book, and\\ntry not only to seem glad, but to be so, and not grudge her one minute\\nof happiness.  But it won\\'t be easy, for it is a dreadful\\ndisappointment,\" and poor Jo bedewed the little fat pincushion she held\\nwith several very bitter tears.\\n\\n\"Jo, dear, I\\'m very selfish, but I couldn\\'t spare you, and I\\'m glad you\\nare not going quite yet,\" whispered Beth, embracing her, basket and\\nall, with such a clinging touch and loving face that Jo felt comforted\\nin spite of the sharp regret that made her want to box her own ears,\\nand humbly beg Aunt Carrol to burden her with this favor, and see how\\ngratefully she would bear it.\\n\\nBy the time Amy came in, Jo was able to take her part in the family\\njubilation, not quite as heartily as usual, perhaps, but without\\nrepinings at Amy\\'s good fortune.  The young lady herself received the\\nnews as tidings of great joy, went about in a solemn sort of rapture,\\nand began to sort her colors and pack her pencils that evening, leaving\\nsuch trifles as clothes, money, and passports to those less absorbed in\\nvisions of art than herself.\\n\\n\"It isn\\'t a mere pleasure trip to me, girls,\" she said impressively, as\\nshe scraped her best palette.  \"It will decide my career, for if I have\\nany genius, I shall find it out in Rome, and will do something to prove\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"Suppose you haven\\'t?\" said Jo, sewing away, with red eyes, at the new\\ncollars which were to be handed over to Amy.\\n\\n\"Then I shall come home and teach drawing for my living,\" replied the\\naspirant for fame, with philosophic composure. But she made a wry face\\nat the prospect, and scratched away at her palette as if bent on\\nvigorous measures before she gave up her hopes.\\n\\n\"No, you won\\'t.  You hate hard work, and you\\'ll marry some rich man,\\nand come home to sit in the lap of luxury all your days,\" said Jo.\\n\\n\"Your predictions sometimes come to pass, but I don\\'t believe that one\\nwill.  I\\'m sure I wish it would, for if I can\\'t be an artist myself, I\\nshould like to be able to help those who are,\" said Amy, smiling, as if\\nthe part of Lady Bountiful would suit her better than that of a poor\\ndrawing teacher.\\n\\n\"Hum!\" said Jo, with a sigh.  \"If you wish it you\\'ll have it, for your\\nwishes are always granted--mine never.\"\\n\\n\"Would you like to go?\" asked Amy, thoughtfully patting her nose with\\nher knife.\\n\\n\"Rather!\"\\n\\n\"Well, in a year or two I\\'ll send for you, and we\\'ll dig in the Forum\\nfor relics, and carry out all the plans we\\'ve made so many times.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you.  I\\'ll remind you of your promise when that joyful day\\ncomes, if it ever does,\" returned Jo, accepting the vague but\\nmagnificent offer as gratefully as she could.\\n\\nThere was not much time for preparation, and the house was in a ferment\\ntill Amy was off.  Jo bore up very well till the last flutter of blue\\nribbon vanished, when she retired to her refuge, the garret, and cried\\ntill she couldn\\'t cry any more. Amy likewise bore up stoutly till the\\nsteamer sailed.  Then just as the gangway was about to be withdrawn, it\\nsuddenly came over her that a whole ocean was soon to roll between her\\nand those who loved her best, and she clung to Laurie, the last\\nlingerer, saying with a sob...\\n\\n\"Oh, take care of them for me, and if anything should happen...\"\\n\\n\"I will, dear, I will, and if anything happens, I\\'ll come and comfort\\nyou,\" whispered Laurie, little dreaming that he would be called upon to\\nkeep his word.\\n\\nSo Amy sailed away to find the Old World, which is always new and\\nbeautiful to young eyes, while her father and friend watched her from\\nthe shore, fervently hoping that none but gentle fortunes would befall\\nthe happy-hearted girl, who waved her hand to them till they could see\\nnothing but the summer sunshine dazzling on the sea.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'THIRTY-ONE\\n\\nOUR FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT\\n\\nLondon\\n\\nDearest People, Here I really sit at a front window of the Bath Hotel,\\nPiccadilly.  It\\'s not a fashionable place, but Uncle stopped here years\\nago, and won\\'t go anywhere else.  However, we don\\'t mean to stay long,\\nso it\\'s no great matter.  Oh, I can\\'t begin to tell you how I enjoy it\\nall!  I never can, so I\\'ll only give you bits out of my notebook, for\\nI\\'ve done nothing but sketch and scribble since I started.\\n\\nI sent a line from Halifax, when I felt pretty miserable, but after\\nthat I got on delightfully, seldom ill, on deck all day, with plenty of\\npleasant people to amuse me.  Everyone was very kind to me, especially\\nthe officers.  Don\\'t laugh, Jo, gentlemen really are very necessary\\naboard ship, to hold on to, or to wait upon one, and as they have\\nnothing to do, it\\'s a mercy to make them useful, otherwise they would\\nsmoke themselves to death, I\\'m afraid.\\n\\nAunt and Flo were poorly all the way, and liked to be let alone, so\\nwhen I had done what I could for them, I went and enjoyed myself.  Such\\nwalks on deck, such sunsets, such splendid air and waves!  It was\\nalmost as exciting as riding a fast horse, when we went rushing on so\\ngrandly.  I wish Beth could have come, it would have done her so much\\ngood.  As for Jo, she would have gone up and sat on the maintop jib, or\\nwhatever the high thing is called, made friends with the engineers, and\\ntooted on the captain\\'s speaking trumpet, she\\'d have been in such a\\nstate of rapture.\\n\\nIt was all heavenly, but I was glad to see the Irish coast, and found\\nit very lovely, so green and sunny, with brown cabins here and there,\\nruins on some of the hills, and gentlemen\\'s countryseats in the\\nvalleys, with deer feeding in the parks. It was early in the morning,\\nbut I didn\\'t regret getting up to see it, for the bay was full of\\nlittle boats, the shore so picturesque, and a rosy sky overhead.  I\\nnever shall forget it.\\n\\nAt Queenstown one of my new acquaintances left us, Mr. Lennox, and when\\nI said something about the Lakes of Killarney, he sighed, and sung,\\nwith a look at me...\\n\\n    \"Oh, have you e\\'er heard of Kate Kearney?\\n    She lives on the banks of Killarney;\\n    From the glance of her eye,\\n    Shun danger and fly,\\n    For fatal\\'s the glance of Kate Kearney.\"\\n\\nWasn\\'t that nonsensical?\\n\\nWe only stopped at Liverpool a few hours.  It\\'s a dirty, noisy place,\\nand I was glad to leave it.  Uncle rushed out and bought a pair of\\ndogskin gloves, some ugly, thick shoes, and an umbrella, and got shaved\\n_à la_ mutton chop, the first thing. Then he flattered himself that he\\nlooked like a true Briton, but the first time he had the mud cleaned\\noff his shoes, the little bootblack knew that an American stood in\\nthem, and said, with a grin, \"There yer har, sir.  I\\'ve given \\'em the\\nlatest Yankee shine.\"  It amused Uncle immensely.  Oh, I must tell you\\nwhat that absurd Lennox did!  He got his friend Ward, who came on with\\nus, to order a bouquet for me, and the first thing I saw in my room was\\na lovely one, with \"Robert Lennox\\'s compliments,\" on the card.  Wasn\\'t\\nthat fun, girls? I like traveling.\\n\\nI never shall get to London if I don\\'t hurry.  The trip was like riding\\nthrough a long picture gallery, full of lovely landscapes. The\\nfarmhouses were my delight, with thatched roofs, ivy up to the eaves,\\nlatticed windows, and stout women with rosy children at the doors.  The\\nvery cattle looked more tranquil than ours, as they stood knee-deep in\\nclover, and the hens had a contented cluck, as if they never got\\nnervous like Yankee biddies.  Such perfect color I never saw, the grass\\nso green, sky so blue, grain so yellow, woods so dark, I was in a\\nrapture all the way.  So was Flo, and we kept bouncing from one side to\\nthe other, trying to see everything while we were whisking along at the\\nrate of sixty miles an hour.  Aunt was tired and went to sleep, but\\nUncle read his guidebook, and wouldn\\'t be astonished at anything. This\\nis the way we went on.  Amy, flying up--\"Oh, that must be Kenilworth,\\nthat gray place among the trees!\"  Flo, darting to my window--\"How\\nsweet!  We must go there sometime, won\\'t we Papa?\" Uncle, calmly\\nadmiring his boots--\"No, my dear, not unless you want beer, that\\'s a\\nbrewery.\"\\n\\nA pause--then Flo cried out, \"Bless me, there\\'s a gallows and a man\\ngoing up.\"  \"Where, where?\" shrieks Amy, staring out at two tall posts\\nwith a crossbeam and some dangling chains.  \"A colliery,\" remarks\\nUncle, with a twinkle of the eye.  \"Here\\'s a lovely flock of lambs all\\nlying down,\" says Amy.  \"See, Papa, aren\\'t they pretty?\" added Flo\\nsentimentally.  \"Geese, young ladies,\" returns Uncle, in a tone that\\nkeeps us quiet till Flo settles down to enjoy the _Flirtations of\\nCaptain Cavendish_, and I have the scenery all to myself.\\n\\nOf course it rained when we got to London, and there was nothing to be\\nseen but fog and umbrellas.  We rested, unpacked, and shopped a little\\nbetween the showers.  Aunt Mary got me some new things, for I came off\\nin such a hurry I wasn\\'t half ready. A white hat and blue feather, a\\nmuslin dress to match, and the loveliest mantle you ever saw.  Shopping\\nin Regent Street is perfectly splendid.  Things seem so cheap, nice\\nribbons only sixpence a yard.  I laid in a stock, but shall get my\\ngloves in Paris.  Doesn\\'t that sound sort of elegant and rich?\\n\\nFlo and I, for the fun of it, ordered a hansom cab, while Aunt and\\nUncle were out, and went for a drive, though we learned afterward that\\nit wasn\\'t the thing for young ladies to ride in them alone.  It was so\\ndroll!  For when we were shut in by the wooden apron, the man drove so\\nfast that Flo was frightened, and told me to stop him, but he was up\\noutside behind somewhere, and I couldn\\'t get at him.  He didn\\'t hear me\\ncall, nor see me flap my parasol in front, and there we were, quite\\nhelpless, rattling away, and whirling around corners at a breakneck\\npace. At last, in my despair, I saw a little door in the roof, and on\\npoking it open, a red eye appeared, and a beery voice said...\\n\\n\"Now, then, mum?\"\\n\\nI gave my order as soberly as I could, and slamming down the door, with\\nan \"Aye, aye, mum,\" the man made his horse walk, as if going to a\\nfuneral.  I poked again and said, \"A little faster,\" then off he went,\\nhelter-skelter as before, and we resigned ourselves to our fate.\\n\\nToday was fair, and we went to Hyde Park, close by, for we are more\\naristocratic than we look.  The Duke of Devonshire lives near.  I often\\nsee his footmen lounging at the back gate, and the Duke of Wellington\\'s\\nhouse is not far off.  Such sights as I saw, my dear!  It was as good\\nas Punch, for there were fat dowagers rolling about in their red and\\nyellow coaches, with gorgeous Jeameses in silk stockings and velvet\\ncoats, up behind, and powdered coachmen in front.  Smart maids, with\\nthe rosiest children I ever saw, handsome girls, looking half asleep,\\ndandies in queer English hats and lavender kids lounging about, and\\ntall soldiers, in short red jackets and muffin caps stuck on one side,\\nlooking so funny I longed to sketch them.\\n\\nRotten Row means \\'Route de Roi\\', or the king\\'s way, but now it\\'s more\\nlike a riding school than anything else.  The horses are splendid, and\\nthe men, especially the grooms, ride well, but the women are stiff, and\\nbounce, which isn\\'t according to our rules.  I longed to show them a\\ntearing American gallop, for they trotted solemnly up and down, in\\ntheir scant habits and high hats, looking like the women in a toy\\nNoah\\'s Ark.  Everyone rides--old men, stout ladies, little\\nchildren--and the young folks do a deal of flirting here, I saw a pair\\nexchange rose buds, for it\\'s the thing to wear one in the button-hole,\\nand I thought it rather a nice little idea.\\n\\nIn the P.M.  to Westminster Abbey, but don\\'t expect me to describe it,\\nthat\\'s impossible, so I\\'ll only say it was sublime! This evening we are\\ngoing to see Fechter, which will be an appropriate end to the happiest\\nday of my life.\\n\\nIt\\'s very late, but I can\\'t let my letter go in the morning without\\ntelling you what happened last evening.  Who do you think came in, as\\nwe were at tea?  Laurie\\'s English friends, Fred and Frank Vaughn!  I\\nwas so surprised, for I shouldn\\'t have known them but for the cards.\\nBoth are tall fellows with whiskers, Fred handsome in the English\\nstyle, and Frank much better, for he only limps slightly, and uses no\\ncrutches.  They had heard from Laurie where we were to be, and came to\\nask us to their house, but Uncle won\\'t go, so we shall return the call,\\nand see them as we can.  They went to the theater with us, and we did\\nhave such a good time, for Frank devoted himself to Flo, and Fred and I\\ntalked over past, present, and future fun as if we had known each other\\nall our days.  Tell Beth Frank asked for her, and was sorry to hear of\\nher ill health.  Fred laughed when I spoke of Jo, and sent his\\n\\'respectful compliments to the big hat\\'. Neither of them had forgotten\\nCamp Laurence, or the fun we had there.  What ages ago it seems,\\ndoesn\\'t it?\\n\\nAunt is tapping on the wall for the third time, so I must stop.  I\\nreally feel like a dissipated London fine lady, writing here so late,\\nwith my room full of pretty things, and my head a jumble of parks,\\ntheaters, new gowns, and gallant creatures who say \"Ah!\" and twirl\\ntheir blond mustaches with the true English lordliness.  I long to see\\nyou all, and in spite of my nonsense am, as ever, your loving...\\n\\nAMY\\n\\n\\nPARIS\\n\\nDear girls,\\n\\nIn my last I told you about our London visit, how kind the Vaughns\\nwere, and what pleasant parties they made for us.  I enjoyed the trips\\nto Hampton Court and the Kensington Museum more than anything else, for\\nat Hampton I saw Raphael\\'s cartoons, and at the Museum, rooms full of\\npictures by Turner, Lawrence, Reynolds, Hogarth, and the other great\\ncreatures.  The day in Richmond Park was charming, for we had a regular\\nEnglish picnic, and I had more splendid oaks and groups of deer than I\\ncould copy, also heard a nightingale, and saw larks go up.  We \\'did\\'\\nLondon to our heart\\'s content, thanks to Fred and Frank, and were sorry\\nto go away, for though English people are slow to take you in, when\\nthey once make up their minds to do it they cannot be outdone in\\nhospitality, I think.  The Vaughns hope to meet us in Rome next winter,\\nand I shall be dreadfully disappointed if they don\\'t, for Grace and I\\nare great friends, and the boys very nice fellows, especially Fred.\\n\\nWell, we were hardly settled here, when he turned up again, saying he\\nhad come for a holiday, and was going to Switzerland. Aunt looked sober\\nat first, but he was so cool about it she couldn\\'t say a word.  And now\\nwe get on nicely, and are very glad he came, for he speaks French like\\na native, and I don\\'t know what we should do without him.  Uncle\\ndoesn\\'t know ten words, and insists on talking English very loud, as if\\nit would make people understand him.  Aunt\\'s pronunciation is\\nold-fashioned, and Flo and I, though we flattered ourselves that we\\nknew a good deal, find we don\\'t, and are very grateful to have Fred do\\nthe \\'_parley vooing_\\', as Uncle calls it.\\n\\nSuch delightful times as we are having!  Sight-seeing from morning till\\nnight, stopping for nice lunches in the gay _cafes_, and meeting with\\nall sorts of droll adventures.  Rainy days I spend in the Louvre,\\nrevelling in pictures.  Jo would turn up her naughty nose at some of\\nthe finest, because she has no soul for art, but I have, and I\\'m\\ncultivating eye and taste as fast as I can.  She would like the relics\\nof great people better, for I\\'ve seen her Napoleon\\'s cocked hat and\\ngray coat, his baby\\'s cradle and his old toothbrush, also Marie\\nAntoinette\\'s little shoe, the ring of Saint Denis, Charlemagne\\'s sword,\\nand many other interesting things.  I\\'ll talk for hours about them when\\nI come, but haven\\'t time to write.\\n\\nThe Palais Royale is a heavenly place, so full of _bijouterie_ and\\nlovely things that I\\'m nearly distracted because I can\\'t buy them.\\nFred wanted to get me some, but of course I didn\\'t allow it.  Then the\\nBois and Champs Elysees are _tres magnifique_. I\\'ve seen the imperial\\nfamily several times, the emperor an ugly, hard-looking man, the\\nempress pale and pretty, but dressed in bad taste, I thought--purple\\ndress, green hat, and yellow gloves. Little Nap is a handsome boy, who\\nsits chatting to his tutor, and kisses his hand to the people as he\\npasses in his four-horse barouche, with postilions in red satin jackets\\nand a mounted guard before and behind.\\n\\nWe often walk in the Tuileries Gardens, for they are lovely, though the\\nantique Luxembourg Gardens suit me better. Pere la Chaise is very\\ncurious, for many of the tombs are like small rooms, and looking in,\\none sees a table, with images or pictures of the dead, and chairs for\\nthe mourners to sit in when they come to lament.  That is so Frenchy.\\n\\nOur rooms are on the Rue de Rivoli, and sitting on the balcony, we look\\nup and down the long, brilliant street.  It is so pleasant that we\\nspend our evenings talking there when too tired with our day\\'s work to\\ngo out.  Fred is very entertaining, and is altogether the most\\nagreeable young man I ever knew--except Laurie, whose manners are more\\ncharming.  I wish Fred was dark, for I don\\'t fancy light men, however,\\nthe Vaughns are very rich and come of an excellent family, so I won\\'t\\nfind fault with their yellow hair, as my own is yellower.\\n\\nNext week we are off to Germany and Switzerland, and as we shall travel\\nfast, I shall only be able to give you hasty letters.  I keep my diary,\\nand try to \\'remember correctly and describe clearly all that I see and\\nadmire\\', as Father advised. It is good practice for me, and with my\\nsketchbook will give you a better idea of my tour than these scribbles.\\n\\nAdieu, I embrace you tenderly. _\"Votre Amie.\"_\\n\\n\\nHEIDELBERG\\n\\nMy dear Mamma,\\n\\nHaving a quiet hour before we leave for Berne, I\\'ll try to tell you\\nwhat has happened, for some of it is very important, as you will see.\\n\\nThe sail up the Rhine was perfect, and I just sat and enjoyed it with\\nall my might.  Get Father\\'s old guidebooks and read about it.  I\\nhaven\\'t words beautiful enough to describe it. At Coblentz we had a\\nlovely time, for some students from Bonn, with whom Fred got acquainted\\non the boat, gave us a serenade. It was a moonlight night, and about\\none o\\'clock Flo and I were waked by the most delicious music under our\\nwindows.  We flew up, and hid behind the curtains, but sly peeps showed\\nus Fred and the students singing away down below.  It was the most\\nromantic thing I ever saw--the river, the bridge of boats, the great\\nfortress opposite, moonlight everywhere, and music fit to melt a heart\\nof stone.\\n\\nWhen they were done we threw down some flowers, and saw them scramble\\nfor them, kiss their hands to the invisible ladies, and go laughing\\naway, to smoke and drink beer, I suppose.  Next morning Fred showed me\\none of the crumpled flowers in his vest pocket, and looked very\\nsentimental.  I laughed at him, and said I didn\\'t throw it, but Flo,\\nwhich seemed to disgust him, for he tossed it out of the window, and\\nturned sensible again.  I\\'m afraid I\\'m going to have trouble with that\\nboy, it begins to look like it.\\n\\nThe baths at Nassau were very gay, so was Baden-Baden, where Fred lost\\nsome money, and I scolded him.  He needs someone to look after him when\\nFrank is not with him.  Kate said once she hoped he\\'d marry soon, and I\\nquite agree with her that it would be well for him.  Frankfurt was\\ndelightful.  I saw Goethe\\'s house, Schiller\\'s statue, and Dannecker\\'s\\nfamous \\'Ariadne.\\'  It was very lovely, but I should have enjoyed it\\nmore if I had known the story better.  I didn\\'t like to ask, as\\neveryone knew it or pretended they did.  I wish Jo would tell me all\\nabout it.  I ought to have read more, for I find I don\\'t know anything,\\nand it mortifies me.\\n\\nNow comes the serious part, for it happened here, and Fred has just\\ngone.  He has been so kind and jolly that we all got quite fond of him.\\nI never thought of anything but a traveling friendship till the\\nserenade night.  Since then I\\'ve begun to feel that the moonlight\\nwalks, balcony talks, and daily adventures were something more to him\\nthan fun.  I haven\\'t flirted, Mother, truly, but remembered what you\\nsaid to me, and have done my very best.  I can\\'t help it if people like\\nme.  I don\\'t try to make them, and it worries me if I don\\'t care for\\nthem, though Jo says I haven\\'t got any heart.  Now I know Mother will\\nshake her head, and the girls say, \"Oh, the mercenary little wretch!\",\\nbut I\\'ve made up my mind, and if Fred asks me, I shall accept him,\\nthough I\\'m not madly in love.  I like him, and we get on comfortably\\ntogether.  He is handsome, young, clever enough, and very rich--ever so\\nmuch richer than the Laurences.  I don\\'t think his family would object,\\nand I should be very happy, for they are all kind, well-bred, generous\\npeople, and they like me.  Fred, as the eldest twin, will have the\\nestate, I suppose, and such a splendid one it is!  A city house in a\\nfashionable street, not so showy as our big houses, but twice as\\ncomfortable and full of solid luxury, such as English people believe\\nin.  I like it, for it\\'s genuine.  I\\'ve seen the plate, the family\\njewels, the old servants, and pictures of the country place, with its\\npark, great house, lovely grounds, and fine horses.  Oh, it would be\\nall I should ask!  And I\\'d rather have it than any title such as girls\\nsnap up so readily, and find nothing behind.  I may be mercenary, but I\\nhate poverty, and don\\'t mean to bear it a minute longer than I can\\nhelp.  One of us _must_ marry well.  Meg didn\\'t, Jo won\\'t, Beth can\\'t\\nyet, so I shall, and make everything okay all round.  I wouldn\\'t marry\\na man I hated or despised.  You may be sure of that, and though Fred is\\nnot my model hero, he does very well, and in time I should get fond\\nenough of him if he was very fond of me, and let me do just as I liked.\\nSo I\\'ve been turning the matter over in my mind the last week, for it\\nwas impossible to help seeing that Fred liked me.  He said nothing, but\\nlittle things showed it.  He never goes with Flo, always gets on my\\nside of the carriage, table, or promenade, looks sentimental when we\\nare alone, and frowns at anyone else who ventures to speak to me.\\nYesterday at dinner, when an Austrian officer stared at us and then\\nsaid something to his friend, a rakish-looking baron, about \\'_ein\\nwonderschones Blondchen\\'_, Fred looked as fierce as a lion, and cut his\\nmeat so savagely it nearly flew off his plate.  He isn\\'t one of the\\ncool, stiff Englishmen, but is rather peppery, for he has Scotch blood\\nin him, as one might guess from his bonnie blue eyes.\\n\\nWell, last evening we went up to the castle about sunset, at least all\\nof us but Fred, who was to meet us there after going to the Post\\nRestante for letters.  We had a charming time poking about the ruins,\\nthe vaults where the monster tun is, and the beautiful gardens made by\\nthe elector long ago for his English wife.  I liked the great terrace\\nbest, for the view was divine, so while the rest went to see the rooms\\ninside, I sat there trying to sketch the gray stone lion\\'s head on the\\nwall, with scarlet woodbine sprays hanging round it.  I felt as if I\\'d\\ngot into a romance, sitting there, watching the Neckar rolling through\\nthe valley, listening to the music of the Austrian band below, and\\nwaiting for my lover, like a real storybook girl.  I had a feeling that\\nsomething was going to happen and I was ready for it.  I didn\\'t feel\\nblushy or quakey, but quite cool and only a little excited.\\n\\nBy-and-by I heard Fred\\'s voice, and then he came hurrying through the\\ngreat arch to find me.  He looked so troubled that I forgot all about\\nmyself, and asked what the matter was.  He said he\\'d just got a letter\\nbegging him to come home, for Frank was very ill.  So he was going at\\nonce on the night train and only had time to say good-by.  I was very\\nsorry for him, and disappointed for myself, but only for a minute\\nbecause he said, as he shook hands, and said it in a way that I could\\nnot mistake,  \"I shall soon come back, you won\\'t forget me, Amy?\"\\n\\nI didn\\'t promise, but I looked at him, and he seemed satisfied, and\\nthere was no time for anything but messages and good-byes, for he was\\noff in an hour, and we all miss him very much. I know he wanted to\\nspeak, but I think, from something he once hinted, that he had promised\\nhis father not to do anything of the sort yet a while, for he is a rash\\nboy, and the old gentleman dreads a foreign daughter-in-law.  We shall\\nsoon meet in Rome, and then, if I don\\'t change my mind, I\\'ll say \"Yes,\\nthank you,\" when he says \"Will you, please?\"\\n\\nOf course this is all _very private_, but I wished you to know what was\\ngoing on.  Don\\'t be anxious about me, remember I am your \\'prudent Amy\\',\\nand be sure I will do nothing rashly. Send me as much advice as you\\nlike.  I\\'ll use it if I can.  I wish I could see you for a good talk,\\nMarmee.  Love and trust me.\\n\\nEver your AMY\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'THIRTY-TWO\\n\\nTENDER TROUBLES\\n\\n\"Jo, I\\'m anxious about Beth.\"\\n\\n\"Why, Mother, she has seemed unusually well since the babies came.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s not her health that troubles me now, it\\'s her spirits. I\\'m sure\\nthere is something on her mind, and I want you to discover what it is.\"\\n\\n\"What makes you think so, Mother?\"\\n\\n\"She sits alone a good deal, and doesn\\'t talk to her father as much as\\nshe used.  I found her crying over the babies the other day.  When she\\nsings, the songs are always sad ones, and now and then I see a look in\\nher face that I don\\'t understand. This isn\\'t like Beth, and it worries\\nme.\"\\n\\n\"Have you asked her about it?\"\\n\\n\"I have tried once or twice, but she either evaded my questions or\\nlooked so distressed that I stopped.  I never force my children\\'s\\nconfidence, and I seldom have to wait for long.\"\\n\\nMrs. March glanced at Jo as she spoke, but the face opposite seemed\\nquite unconscious of any secret disquietude but Beth\\'s, and after\\nsewing thoughtfully for a minute, Jo said, \"I think she is growing up,\\nand so begins to dream dreams, and have hopes and fears and fidgets,\\nwithout knowing why or being able to explain them.  Why, Mother, Beth\\'s\\neighteen, but we don\\'t realize it, and treat her like a child,\\nforgetting she\\'s a woman.\"\\n\\n\"So she is.  Dear heart, how fast you do grow up,\" returned her mother\\nwith a sigh and a smile.\\n\\n\"Can\\'t be helped, Marmee, so you must resign yourself to all sorts of\\nworries, and let your birds hop out of the nest, one by one.  I promise\\nnever to hop very far, if that is any comfort to you.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a great comfort, Jo.  I always feel strong when you are at home,\\nnow Meg is gone.  Beth is too feeble and Amy too young to depend upon,\\nbut when the tug comes, you are always ready.\"\\n\\n\"Why, you know I don\\'t mind hard jobs much, and there must always be\\none scrub in a family.  Amy is splendid in fine works and I\\'m not, but\\nI feel in my element when all the carpets are to be taken up, or half\\nthe family fall sick at once. Amy is distinguishing herself abroad, but\\nif anything is amiss at home, I\\'m your man.\"\\n\\n\"I leave Beth to your hands, then, for she will open her tender little\\nheart to her Jo sooner than to anyone else.  Be very kind, and don\\'t\\nlet her think anyone watches or talks about her.  If she only would get\\nquite strong and cheerful again, I shouldn\\'t have a wish in the world.\"\\n\\n\"Happy woman!  I\\'ve got heaps.\"\\n\\n\"My dear, what are they?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll settle Bethy\\'s troubles, and then I\\'ll tell you mine. They are\\nnot very wearing, so they\\'ll keep.\" and Jo stitched away, with a wise\\nnod which set her mother\\'s heart at rest about her for the present at\\nleast.\\n\\nWhile apparently absorbed in her own affairs, Jo watched Beth, and\\nafter many conflicting conjectures, finally settled upon one which\\nseemed to explain the change in her.  A slight incident gave Jo the\\nclue to the mystery, she thought, and lively fancy, loving heart did\\nthe rest.  She was affecting to write busily one Saturday afternoon,\\nwhen she and Beth were alone together.  Yet as she scribbled, she kept\\nher eye on her sister, who seemed unusually quiet.  Sitting at the\\nwindow, Beth\\'s work often dropped into her lap, and she leaned her head\\nupon her hand, in a dejected attitude, while her eyes rested on the\\ndull, autumnal landscape.  Suddenly some one passed below, whistling\\nlike an operatic blackbird, and a voice called out, \"All serene! Coming\\nin tonight.\"\\n\\nBeth started, leaned forward, smiled and nodded, watched the passer-by\\ntill his quick tramp died away, then said softly as if to herself, \"How\\nstrong and well and happy that dear boy looks.\"\\n\\n\"Hum!\" said Jo, still intent upon her sister\\'s face, for the bright\\ncolor faded as quickly as it came, the smile vanished, and presently a\\ntear lay shining on the window ledge.  Beth whisked it off, and in her\\nhalf-averted face read a tender sorrow that made her own eyes fill.\\nFearing to betray herself, she slipped away, murmuring something about\\nneeding more paper.\\n\\n\"Mercy on me, Beth loves Laurie!\" she said, sitting down in her own\\nroom, pale with the shock of the discovery which she believed she had\\njust made.  \"I never dreamed of such a thing. What will Mother say?  I\\nwonder if her...\"  there Jo stopped and turned scarlet with a sudden\\nthought.  \"If he shouldn\\'t love back again, how dreadful it would be.\\nHe must.  I\\'ll make him!\" and she shook her head threateningly at the\\npicture of the mischievous-looking boy laughing at her from the wall.\\n\"Oh dear, we are growing up with a vengeance.  Here\\'s Meg married and a\\nmamma, Amy flourishing away at Paris, and Beth in love.  I\\'m the only\\none that has sense enough to keep out of mischief.\" Jo thought intently\\nfor a minute with her eyes fixed on the picture, then she smoothed out\\nher wrinkled forehead and said, with a decided nod at the face\\nopposite, \"No thank you, sir, you\\'re very charming, but you\\'ve no more\\nstability than a weathercock.  So you needn\\'t write touching notes and\\nsmile in that insinuating way, for it won\\'t do a bit of good, and I\\nwon\\'t have it.\"\\n\\nThen she sighed, and fell into a reverie from which she did not wake\\ntill the early twilight sent her down to take new observations, which\\nonly confirmed her suspicion.  Though Laurie flirted with Amy and joked\\nwith Jo, his manner to Beth had always been peculiarly kind and gentle,\\nbut so was everybody\\'s. Therefore, no one thought of imagining that he\\ncared more for her than for the others.  Indeed, a general impression\\nhad prevailed in the family of late that \\'our boy\\' was getting fonder\\nthan ever of Jo, who, however, wouldn\\'t hear a word upon the subject\\nand scolded violently if anyone dared to suggest it. If they had known\\nthe various tender passages which had been nipped in the bud, they\\nwould have had the immense satisfaction of saying, \"I told you so.\"\\nBut Jo hated \\'philandering\\', and wouldn\\'t allow it, always having a\\njoke or a smile ready at the least sign of impending danger.\\n\\nWhen Laurie first went to college, he fell in love about once a month,\\nbut these small flames were as brief as ardent, did no damage, and much\\namused Jo, who took great interest in the alternations of hope,\\ndespair, and resignation, which were confided to her in their weekly\\nconferences.  But there came a time when Laurie ceased to worship at\\nmany shrines, hinted darkly at one all-absorbing passion, and indulged\\noccasionally in Byronic fits of gloom.  Then he avoided the tender\\nsubject altogether, wrote philosophical notes to Jo, turned studious,\\nand gave out that he was going to \\'dig\\', intending to graduate in a\\nblaze of glory.  This suited the young lady better than twilight\\nconfidences, tender pressures of the hand, and eloquent glances of the\\neye, for with Jo, brain developed earlier than heart, and she preferred\\nimaginary heroes to real ones, because when tired of them, the former\\ncould be shut up in the tin kitchen till called for, and the latter\\nwere less manageable.\\n\\nThings were in this state when the grand discovery was made, and Jo\\nwatched Laurie that night as she had never done before.  If she had not\\ngot the new idea into her head, she would have seen nothing unusual in\\nthe fact that Beth was very quiet, and Laurie very kind to her.  But\\nhaving given the rein to her lively fancy, it galloped away with her at\\na great pace, and common sense, being rather weakened by a long course\\nof romance writing, did not come to the rescue.  As usual Beth lay on\\nthe sofa and Laurie sat in a low chair close by, amusing her with all\\nsorts of gossip, for she depended on her weekly \\'spin\\', and he never\\ndisappointed her.  But that evening Jo fancied that Beth\\'s eyes rested\\non the lively, dark face beside her with peculiar pleasure, and that\\nshe listened with intense interest to an account of some exciting\\ncricket match, though the phrases, \\'caught off a tice\\', \\'stumped off\\nhis ground\\', and \\'the leg hit for three\\', were as intelligible to her\\nas Sanskrit.  She also fancied, having set her heart upon seeing it,\\nthat she saw a certain increase of gentleness in Laurie\\'s manner, that\\nhe dropped his voice now and then, laughed less than usual, was a\\nlittle absent-minded, and settled the afghan over Beth\\'s feet with an\\nassiduity that was really almost tender.\\n\\n\"Who knows?  Stranger things have happened,\" thought Jo, as she fussed\\nabout the room.  \"She will make quite an angel of him, and he will make\\nlife delightfully easy and pleasant for the dear, if they only love\\neach other.  I don\\'t see how he can help it, and I do believe he would\\nif the rest of us were out of the way.\"\\n\\nAs everyone was out of the way but herself, Jo began to feel that she\\nought to dispose of herself with all speed.  But where should she go?\\nAnd burning to lay herself upon the shrine of sisterly devotion, she\\nsat down to settle that point.\\n\\nNow, the old sofa was a regular patriarch of a sofa--long, broad,\\nwell-cushioned, and low, a trifle shabby, as well it might be, for the\\ngirls had slept and sprawled on it as babies, fished over the back,\\nrode on the arms, and had menageries under it as children, and rested\\ntired heads, dreamed dreams, and listened to tender talk on it as young\\nwomen.  They all loved it, for it was a family refuge, and one corner\\nhad always been Jo\\'s favorite lounging place.  Among the many pillows\\nthat adorned the venerable couch was one, hard, round, covered with\\nprickly horsehair, and furnished with a knobby button at each end.\\nThis repulsive pillow was her especial property, being used as a weapon\\nof defense, a barricade, or a stern preventive of too much slumber.\\n\\nLaurie knew this pillow well, and had cause to regard it with deep\\naversion, having been unmercifully pummeled with it in former days when\\nromping was allowed, and now frequently debarred by it from the seat he\\nmost coveted next to Jo in the sofa corner.  If \\'the sausage\\' as they\\ncalled it, stood on end, it was a sign that he might approach and\\nrepose, but if it lay flat across the sofa, woe to man, woman, or child\\nwho dared disturb it!  That evening Jo forgot to barricade her corner,\\nand had not been in her seat five minutes, before a massive form\\nappeared beside her, and with both arms spread over the sofa back, both\\nlong legs stretched out before him, Laurie exclaimed, with a sigh of\\nsatisfaction...\\n\\n\"Now, this is filling at the price.\"\\n\\n\"No slang,\" snapped Jo, slamming down the pillow.  But it was too late,\\nthere was no room for it, and coasting onto the floor, it disappeared\\nin a most mysterious manner.\\n\\n\"Come, Jo, don\\'t be thorny.  After studying himself to a skeleton all\\nthe week, a fellow deserves petting and ought to get it.\"\\n\\n\"Beth will pet you.  I\\'m busy.\"\\n\\n\"No, she\\'s not to be bothered with me, but you like that sort of thing,\\nunless you\\'ve suddenly lost your taste for it.  Have you? Do you hate\\nyour boy, and want to fire pillows at him?\"\\n\\nAnything more wheedlesome than that touching appeal was seldom heard,\\nbut Jo quenched \\'her boy\\' by turning on him with a stern query, \"How\\nmany bouquets have you sent Miss Randal this week?\"\\n\\n\"Not one, upon my word.  She\\'s engaged.  Now then.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad of it, that\\'s one of your foolish extravagances, sending\\nflowers and things to girls for whom you don\\'t care two pins,\"\\ncontinued Jo reprovingly.\\n\\n\"Sensible girls for whom I do care whole papers of pins won\\'t let me\\nsend them \\'flowers and things\\', so what can I do? My feelings need a\\n\\'vent\\'.\"\\n\\n\"Mother doesn\\'t approve of flirting even in fun, and you do flirt\\ndesperately, Teddy.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d give anything if I could answer, \\'So do you\\'.  As I can\\'t, I\\'ll\\nmerely say that I don\\'t see any harm in that pleasant little game, if\\nall parties understand that it\\'s only play.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it does look pleasant, but I can\\'t learn how it\\'s done. I\\'ve\\ntried, because one feels awkward in company not to do as everybody else\\nis doing, but I don\\'t seem to get on\", said Jo, forgetting to play\\nmentor.\\n\\n\"Take lessons of Amy, she has a regular talent for it.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, she does it very prettily, and never seems to go too far.  I\\nsuppose it\\'s natural to some people to please without trying, and\\nothers to always say and do the wrong thing in the wrong place.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad you can\\'t flirt.  It\\'s really refreshing to see a sensible,\\nstraightforward girl, who can be jolly and kind without making a fool\\nof herself.  Between ourselves, Jo, some of the girls I know really do\\ngo on at such a rate I\\'m ashamed of them. They don\\'t mean any harm, I\\'m\\nsure, but if they knew how we fellows talked about them afterward,\\nthey\\'d mend their ways, I fancy.\"\\n\\n\"They do the same, and as their tongues are the sharpest, you fellows\\nget the worst of it, for you are as silly as they, every bit.  If you\\nbehaved properly, they would, but knowing you like their nonsense, they\\nkeep it up, and then you blame them.\"\\n\\n\"Much you know about it, ma\\'am,\" said Laurie in a superior tone. \"We\\ndon\\'t like romps and flirts, though we may act as if we did sometimes.\\nThe pretty, modest girls are never talked about, except respectfully,\\namong gentleman. Bless your innocent soul!  If you could be in my place\\nfor a month you\\'d see things that would astonish you a trifle. Upon my\\nword, when I see one of those harum-scarum girls, I always want to say\\nwith our friend Cock Robin...\\n\\n    \"Out upon you, fie upon you,\\n     Bold-faced jig!\"\\n\\nIt was impossible to help laughing at the funny conflict between\\nLaurie\\'s chivalrous reluctance to speak ill of womankind, and his very\\nnatural dislike of the unfeminine folly of which fashionable society\\nshowed him many samples.  Jo knew that \\'young Laurence\\' was regarded as\\na most eligible parti by worldly mamas, was much smiled upon by their\\ndaughters, and flattered enough by ladies of all ages to make a coxcomb\\nof him, so she watched him rather jealously, fearing he would be\\nspoiled, and rejoiced more than she confessed to find that he still\\nbelieved in modest girls.  Returning suddenly to her admonitory tone,\\nshe said, dropping her voice, \"If you must have a \\'vent\\', Teddy, go and\\ndevote yourself to one of the \\'pretty, modest girls\\' whom you do\\nrespect, and not waste your time with the silly ones.\"\\n\\n\"You really advise it?\" and Laurie looked at her with an odd mixture of\\nanxiety and merriment in his face.\\n\\n\"Yes, I do, but you\\'d better wait till you are through college, on the\\nwhole, and be fitting yourself for the place meantime.  You\\'re not half\\ngood enough for--well, whoever the modest girl may be.\" and Jo looked a\\nlittle queer likewise, for a name had almost escaped her.\\n\\n\"That I\\'m not!\" acquiesced Laurie, with an expression of humility quite\\nnew to him, as he dropped his eyes and absently wound Jo\\'s apron tassel\\nround his finger.\\n\\n\"Mercy on us, this will never do,\" thought Jo, adding aloud, \"Go and\\nsing to me.  I\\'m dying for some music, and always like yours.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d rather stay here, thank you.\"\\n\\n\"Well, you can\\'t, there isn\\'t room.  Go and make yourself useful, since\\nyou are too big to be ornamental.  I thought you hated to be tied to a\\nwoman\\'s apron string?\" retorted Jo, quoting certain rebellious words of\\nhis own.\\n\\n\"Ah, that depends on who wears the apron!\" and Laurie gave an audacious\\ntweak at the tassel.\\n\\n\"Are you going?\" demanded Jo, diving for the pillow.\\n\\nHe fled at once, and the minute it was well, \"Up with the bonnets of\\nbonnie Dundee,\" she slipped away to return no more till the young\\ngentleman departed in high dudgeon.\\n\\nJo lay long awake that night, and was just dropping off when the sound\\nof a stifled sob made her fly to Beth\\'s bedside, with the anxious\\ninquiry, \"What is it, dear?\"\\n\\n\"I thought you were asleep,\" sobbed Beth.\\n\\n\"Is it the old pain, my precious?\"\\n\\n\"No, it\\'s a new one, but I can bear it,\" and Beth tried to check her\\ntears.\\n\\n\"Tell me all about it, and let me cure it as I often did the other.\"\\n\\n\"You can\\'t, there is no cure.\"  There Beth\\'s voice gave way, and\\nclinging to her sister, she cried so despairingly that Jo was\\nfrightened.\\n\\n\"Where is it?  Shall I call Mother?\"\\n\\n\"No, no, don\\'t call her, don\\'t tell her.  I shall be better soon.  Lie\\ndown here and \\'poor\\' my head.  I\\'ll be quiet and go to sleep, indeed I\\nwill.\"\\n\\nJo obeyed, but as her hand went softly to and fro across Beth\\'s hot\\nforehead and wet eyelids, her heart was very full and she longed to\\nspeak.  But young as she was, Jo had learned that hearts, like flowers,\\ncannot be rudely handled, but must open naturally, so though she\\nbelieved she knew the cause of Beth\\'s new pain, she only said, in her\\ntenderest tone, \"Does anything trouble you, deary?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Jo,\" after a long pause.\\n\\n\"Wouldn\\'t it comfort you to tell me what it is?\"\\n\\n\"Not now, not yet.\"\\n\\n\"Then I won\\'t ask, but remember, Bethy, that Mother and Jo are always\\nglad to hear and help you, if they can.\"\\n\\n\"I know it.  I\\'ll tell you by-and-by.\"\\n\\n\"Is the pain better now?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, much better, you are so comfortable, Jo.\"\\n\\n\"Go to sleep, dear.  I\\'ll stay with you.\"\\n\\nSo cheek to cheek they fell asleep, and on the morrow Beth seemed quite\\nherself again, for at eighteen neither heads nor hearts ache long, and\\na loving word can medicine most ills.\\n\\nBut Jo had made up her mind, and after pondering over a project for\\nsome days, she confided it to her mother.\\n\\n\"You asked me the other day what my wishes were.  I\\'ll tell you one of\\nthem, Marmee,\" she began, as they sat along together.  \"I want to go\\naway somewhere this winter for a change.\"\\n\\n\"Why, Jo?\" and her mother looked up quickly, as if the words suggested\\na double meaning.\\n\\nWith her eyes on her work Jo answered soberly, \"I want something new.\\nI feel restless and anxious to be seeing, doing, and learning more than\\nI am.  I brood too much over my own small affairs, and need stirring\\nup, so as I can be spared this winter, I\\'d like to hop a little way and\\ntry my wings.\"\\n\\n\"Where will you hop?\"\\n\\n\"To New York.  I had a bright idea yesterday, and this is it.  You know\\nMrs. Kirke wrote to you for some respectable young person to teach her\\nchildren and sew.  It\\'s rather hard to find just the thing, but I think\\nI should suit if I tried.\"\\n\\n\"My dear, go out to service in that great boarding house!\" and Mrs.\\nMarch looked surprised, but not displeased.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not exactly going out to service, for Mrs. Kirke is your\\nfriend--the kindest soul that ever lived--and would make things\\npleasant for me, I know.  Her family is separate from the rest, and no\\none knows me there.  Don\\'t care if they do. It\\'s honest work, and I\\'m\\nnot ashamed of it.\"\\n\\n\"Nor I.  But your writing?\"\\n\\n\"All the better for the change.  I shall see and hear new things, get\\nnew ideas, and even if I haven\\'t much time there, I shall bring home\\nquantities of material for my rubbish.\"\\n\\n\"I have no doubt of it, but are these your only reasons for this sudden\\nfancy?\"\\n\\n\"No, Mother.\"\\n\\n\"May I know the others?\"\\n\\nJo looked up and Jo looked down, then said slowly, with sudden color in\\nher cheeks.  \"It may be vain and wrong to say it, but--I\\'m\\nafraid--Laurie is getting too fond of me.\"\\n\\n\"Then you don\\'t care for him in the way it is evident he begins to care\\nfor you?\" and Mrs. March looked anxious as she put the question.\\n\\n\"Mercy, no!  I love the dear boy, as I always have, and am immensely\\nproud of him, but as for anything more, it\\'s out of the question.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad of that, Jo.\"\\n\\n\"Why, please?\"\\n\\n\"Because, dear, I don\\'t think you suited to one another.  As friends\\nyou are very happy, and your frequent quarrels soon blow over, but I\\nfear you would both rebel if you were mated for life. You are too much\\nalike and too fond of freedom, not to mention hot tempers and strong\\nwills, to get on happily together, in a relation which needs infinite\\npatience and forbearance, as well as love.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s just the feeling I had, though I couldn\\'t express it. I\\'m glad\\nyou think he is only beginning to care for me.  It would trouble me\\nsadly to make him unhappy, for I couldn\\'t fall in love with the dear\\nold fellow merely out of gratitude, could I?\"\\n\\n\"You are sure of his feeling for you?\"\\n\\nThe color deepened in Jo\\'s cheeks as she answered, with the look of\\nmingled pleasure, pride, and pain which young girls wear when speaking\\nof first lovers, \"I\\'m afraid it is so, Mother.  He hasn\\'t said\\nanything, but he looks a great deal. I think I had better go away\\nbefore it comes to anything.\"\\n\\n\"I agree with you, and if it can be managed you shall go.\"\\n\\nJo looked relieved, and after a pause, said, smiling, \"How Mrs. Moffat\\nwould wonder at your want of management, if she knew, and how she will\\nrejoice that Annie may still hope.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, Jo, mothers may differ in their management, but the hope is the\\nsame in all--the desire to see their children happy. Meg is so, and I\\nam content with her success.  You I leave to enjoy your liberty till\\nyou tire of it, for only then will you find that there is something\\nsweeter.  Amy is my chief care now, but her good sense will help her.\\nFor Beth, I indulge no hopes except that she may be well.  By the way,\\nshe seems brighter this last day or two.  Have you spoken to her?\\'\\n\\n\"Yes, she owned she had a trouble, and promised to tell me by-and-by.\\nI said no more, for I think I know it,\" and Jo told her little story.\\n\\nMrs. March shook her head, and did not take so romantic a view of the\\ncase, but looked grave, and repeated her opinion that for Laurie\\'s sake\\nJo should go away for a time.\\n\\n\"Let us say nothing about it to him till the plan is settled, then I\\'ll\\nrun away before he can collect his wits and be tragic. Beth must think\\nI\\'m going to please myself, as I am, for I can\\'t talk about Laurie to\\nher.  But she can pet and comfort him after I\\'m gone, and so cure him\\nof this romantic notion.  He\\'s been through so many little trials of\\nthe sort, he\\'s used to it, and will soon get over his lovelornity.\"\\n\\nJo spoke hopefully, but could not rid herself of the foreboding fear\\nthat this \\'little trial\\' would be harder than the others, and that\\nLaurie would not get over his \\'lovelornity\\' as easily as heretofore.\\n\\nThe plan was talked over in a family council and agreed upon, for Mrs.\\nKirke gladly accepted Jo, and promised to make a pleasant home for her.\\nThe teaching would render her independent, and such leisure as she got\\nmight be made profitable by writing, while the new scenes and society\\nwould be both useful and agreeable.  Jo liked the prospect and was\\neager to be gone, for the home nest was growing too narrow for her\\nrestless nature and adventurous spirit.  When all was settled, with\\nfear and trembling she told Laurie, but to her surprise he took it very\\nquietly.  He had been graver than usual of late, but very pleasant, and\\nwhen jokingly accused of turning over a new leaf, he answered soberly,\\n\"So I am, and I mean this one shall stay turned.\"\\n\\nJo was very much relieved that one of his virtuous fits should come on\\njust then, and made her preparations with a lightened heart, for Beth\\nseemed more cheerful, and hoped she was doing the best for all.\\n\\n\"One thing I leave in your especial care,\" she said, the night before\\nshe left.\\n\\n\"You mean your papers?\" asked Beth.\\n\\n\"No, my boy.  Be very good to him, won\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Of course I will, but I can\\'t fill your place, and he\\'ll miss you\\nsadly.\"\\n\\n\"It won\\'t hurt him, so remember, I leave him in your charge, to plague,\\npet, and keep in order.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll do my best, for your sake,\" promised Beth, wondering why Jo\\nlooked at her so queerly.\\n\\nWhen Laurie said good-by, he whispered significantly, \"It won\\'t do a\\nbit of good, Jo.  My eye is on you, so mind what you do, or I\\'ll come\\nand bring you home.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'THIRTY-THREE\\n\\nJO\\'S JOURNAL\\n\\nNew York, November\\n\\nDear Marmee and Beth,\\n\\nI\\'m going to write you a regular volume, for I\\'ve got heaps to tell,\\nthough I\\'m not a fine young lady traveling on the continent. When I\\nlost sight of Father\\'s dear old face, I felt a trifle blue, and might\\nhave shed a briny drop or two, if an Irish lady with four small\\nchildren, all crying more or less, hadn\\'t diverted my mind, for I\\namused myself by dropping gingerbread nuts over the seat every time\\nthey opened their mouths to roar.\\n\\nSoon the sun came out, and taking it as a good omen, I cleared up\\nlikewise and enjoyed my journey with all my heart.\\n\\nMrs. Kirke welcomed me so kindly I felt at home at once, even in that\\nbig house full of strangers.  She gave me a funny little sky\\nparlor--all she had, but there is a stove in it, and a nice table in a\\nsunny window, so I can sit here and write whenever I like.  A fine view\\nand a church tower opposite atone for the many stairs, and I took a\\nfancy to my den on the spot. The nursery, where I am to teach and sew,\\nis a pleasant room next Mrs. Kirke\\'s private parlor, and the two little\\ngirls are pretty children, rather spoiled, I fancy, but they took to me\\nafter telling them The Seven Bad Pigs, and I\\'ve no doubt I shall make a\\nmodel governess.\\n\\nI am to have my meals with the children, if I prefer it to the great\\ntable, and for the present I do, for I am bashful, though no one will\\nbelieve it.\\n\\n\"Now, my dear, make yourself at home,\" said Mrs. K.  in her motherly\\nway, \"I\\'m on the drive from morning to night, as you may suppose with\\nsuch a family, but a great anxiety will be off my mind if I know the\\nchildren are safe with you.  My rooms are always open to you, and your\\nown shall be as comfortable as I can make it.  There are some pleasant\\npeople in the house if you feel sociable, and your evenings are always\\nfree.  Come to me if anything goes wrong, and be as happy as you can.\\nThere\\'s the tea bell, I must run and change my cap.\"  And off she\\nbustled, leaving me to settle myself in my new nest.\\n\\nAs I went downstairs soon after, I saw something I liked. The flights\\nare very long in this tall house, and as I stood waiting at the head of\\nthe third one for a little servant girl to lumber up, I saw a gentleman\\ncome along behind her, take the heavy hod of coal out of her hand,\\ncarry it all the way up, put it down at a door near by, and walk away,\\nsaying, with a kind nod and a foreign accent, \"It goes better so.  The\\nlittle back is too young to haf such heaviness.\"\\n\\nWasn\\'t it good of him?  I like such things, for as Father says, trifles\\nshow character.  When I mentioned it to Mrs. K., that evening, she\\nlaughed, and said, \"That must have been Professor Bhaer, he\\'s always\\ndoing things of that sort.\"\\n\\nMrs. K.  told me he was from Berlin, very learned and good, but poor as\\na church mouse, and gives lessons to support himself and two little\\norphan nephews whom he is educating here, according to the wishes of\\nhis sister, who married an American.  Not a very romantic story, but it\\ninterested me, and I was glad to hear that Mrs. K.  lends him her\\nparlor for some of his scholars. There is a glass door between it and\\nthe nursery, and I mean to peep at him, and then I\\'ll tell you how he\\nlooks.  He\\'s almost forty, so it\\'s no harm, Marmee.\\n\\nAfter tea and a go-to-bed romp with the little girls, I attacked the\\nbig workbasket, and had a quiet evening chatting with my new friend.  I\\nshall keep a journal-letter, and send it once a week, so goodnight, and\\nmore tomorrow.\\n\\nTuesday Eve\\n\\nHad a lively time in my seminary this morning, for the children acted\\nlike Sancho, and at one time I really thought I should shake them all\\nround.  Some good angel inspired me to try gymnastics, and I kept it up\\ntill they were glad to sit down and keep still.  After luncheon, the\\ngirl took them out for a walk, and I went to my needlework like little\\nMabel \\'with a willing mind\\'.  I was thanking my stars that I\\'d learned\\nto make nice buttonholes, when the parlor door opened and shut, and\\nsomeone began to hum, Kennst Du Das Land, like a big bumblebee. It was\\ndreadfully improper, I know, but I couldn\\'t resist the temptation, and\\nlifting one end of the curtain before the glass door, I peeped in.\\nProfessor Bhaer was there, and while he arranged his books, I took a\\ngood look at him.  A regular German--rather stout, with brown hair\\ntumbled all over his head, a bushy beard, good nose, the kindest eyes I\\never saw, and a splendid big voice that does one\\'s ears good, after our\\nsharp or slipshod American gabble.  His clothes were rusty, his hands\\nwere large, and he hadn\\'t a really handsome feature in his face, except\\nhis beautiful teeth, yet I liked him, for he had a fine head, his linen\\nwas very nice, and he looked like a gentleman, though two buttons were\\noff his coat and there was a patch on one shoe.  He looked sober in\\nspite of his humming, till he went to the window to turn the hyacinth\\nbulbs toward the sun, and stroke the cat, who received him like an old\\nfriend.  Then he smiled, and when a tap came at the door, called out in\\na loud, brisk tone, \"Herein!\"\\n\\nI was just going to run, when I caught sight of a morsel of a child\\ncarrying a big book, and stopped, to see what was going on.\\n\\n\"Me wants me Bhaer,\" said the mite, slamming down her book and running\\nto meet him.\\n\\n\"Thou shalt haf thy Bhaer.  Come, then, and take a goot hug from him,\\nmy Tina,\" said the Professor, catching her up with a laugh, and holding\\nher so high over his head that she had to stoop her little face to kiss\\nhim.\\n\\n\"Now me mus tuddy my lessin,\" went on the funny little thing.  So he\\nput her up at the table, opened the great dictionary she had brought,\\nand gave her a paper and pencil, and she scribbled away, turning a leaf\\nnow and then, and passing her little fat finger down the page, as if\\nfinding a word, so soberly that I nearly betrayed myself by a laugh,\\nwhile Mr. Bhaer stood stroking her pretty hair with a fatherly look\\nthat made me think she must be his own, though she looked more French\\nthan German.\\n\\nAnother knock and the appearance of two young ladies sent me back to my\\nwork, and there I virtuously remained through all the noise and\\ngabbling that went on next door.  One of the girls kept laughing\\naffectedly, and saying, \"Now Professor,\" in a coquettish tone, and the\\nother pronounced her German with an accent that must have made it hard\\nfor him to keep sober.\\n\\nBoth seemed to try his patience sorely, for more than once I heard him\\nsay emphatically, \"No, no, it is not so, you haf not attend to what I\\nsay,\" and once there was a loud rap, as if he struck the table with his\\nbook, followed by the despairing exclamation, \"Prut!  It all goes bad\\nthis day.\"\\n\\nPoor man, I pitied him, and when the girls were gone, took just one\\nmore peep to see if he survived it.  He seemed to have thrown himself\\nback in his chair, tired out, and sat there with his eyes shut till the\\nclock struck two, when he jumped up, put his books in his pocket, as if\\nready for another lesson, and taking little Tina who had fallen asleep\\non the sofa in his arms, he carried her quietly away.  I fancy he has a\\nhard life of it.  Mrs. Kirke asked me if I wouldn\\'t go down to the five\\no\\'clock dinner, and feeling a little bit homesick, I thought I would,\\njust to see what sort of people are under the same roof with me.  So I\\nmade myself respectable and tried to slip in behind Mrs. Kirke, but as\\nshe is short and I\\'m tall, my efforts at concealment were rather a\\nfailure.  She gave me a seat by her, and after my face cooled off, I\\nplucked up courage and looked about me.  The long table was full, and\\nevery one intent on getting their dinner, the gentlemen especially, who\\nseemed to be eating on time, for they bolted in every sense of the\\nword, vanishing as soon as they were done.  There was the usual\\nassortment of young men absorbed in themselves, young couples absorbed\\nin each other, married ladies in their babies, and old gentlemen in\\npolitics.  I don\\'t think I shall care to have much to do with any of\\nthem, except one sweetfaced maiden lady, who looks as if she had\\nsomething in her.\\n\\nCast away at the very bottom of the table was the Professor, shouting\\nanswers to the questions of a very inquisitive, deaf old gentleman on\\none side, and talking philosophy with a Frenchman on the other.  If Amy\\nhad been here, she\\'d have turned her back on him forever because, sad\\nto relate, he had a great appetite, and shoveled in his dinner in a\\nmanner which would have horrified \\'her ladyship\\'.  I didn\\'t mind, for I\\nlike \\'to see folks eat with a relish\\', as Hannah says, and the poor man\\nmust have needed a deal of food after teaching idiots all day.\\n\\nAs I went upstairs after dinner, two of the young men were settling\\ntheir hats before the hall mirror, and I heard one say low to the\\nother, \"Who\\'s the new party?\"\\n\\n\"Governess, or something of that sort.\"\\n\\n\"What the deuce is she at our table for?\"\\n\\n\"Friend of the old lady\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"Handsome head, but no style.\"\\n\\n\"Not a bit of it.  Give us a light and come on.\"\\n\\nI felt angry at first, and then I didn\\'t care, for a governess is as\\ngood as a clerk, and I\\'ve got sense, if I haven\\'t style, which is more\\nthan some people have, judging from the remarks of the elegant beings\\nwho clattered away, smoking like bad chimneys.  I hate ordinary people!\\n\\n\\nThursday\\n\\nYesterday was a quiet day spent in teaching, sewing, and writing in my\\nlittle room, which is very cozy, with a light and fire.  I picked up a\\nfew bits of news and was introduced to the Professor.  It seems that\\nTina is the child of the Frenchwoman who does the fine ironing in the\\nlaundry here.  The little thing has lost her heart to Mr. Bhaer, and\\nfollows him about the house like a dog whenever he is at home, which\\ndelights him, as he is very fond of children, though a \\'bacheldore\\'.\\nKitty and Minnie Kirke likewise regard him with affection, and tell all\\nsorts of stories about the plays he invents, the presents he brings,\\nand the splendid tales he tells.  The younger men quiz him, it seems,\\ncall him Old Fritz, Lager Beer, Ursa Major, and make all manner of\\njokes on his name.  But he enjoys it like a boy, Mrs. Kirke says, and\\ntakes it so good-naturedly that they all like him in spite of his\\nforeign ways.\\n\\nThe maiden lady is a Miss Norton, rich, cultivated, and kind.  She\\nspoke to me at dinner today (for I went to table again, it\\'s such fun\\nto watch people), and asked me to come and see her at her room.  She\\nhas fine books and pictures, knows interesting persons, and seems\\nfriendly, so I shall make myself agreeable, for I do want to get into\\ngood society, only it isn\\'t the same sort that Amy likes.\\n\\nI was in our parlor last evening when Mr. Bhaer came in with some\\nnewspapers for Mrs. Kirke.  She wasn\\'t there, but Minnie, who is a\\nlittle old woman, introduced me very prettily. \"This is Mamma\\'s friend,\\nMiss March.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and she\\'s jolly and we like her lots,\" added Kitty, who is an\\n\\'enfant terrible\\'.\\n\\nWe both bowed, and then we laughed, for the prim introduction and the\\nblunt addition were rather a comical contrast.\\n\\n\"Ah, yes, I hear these naughty ones go to vex you, Mees Marsch.  If so\\nagain, call at me and I come,\" he said, with a threatening frown that\\ndelighted the little wretches.\\n\\nI promised I would, and he departed, but it seems as if I was doomed to\\nsee a good deal of him, for today as I passed his door on my way out,\\nby accident I knocked against it with my umbrella.  It flew open, and\\nthere he stood in his dressing gown, with a big blue sock on one hand\\nand a darning needle in the other.  He didn\\'t seem at all ashamed of\\nit, for when I explained and hurried on, he waved his hand, sock and\\nall, saying in his loud, cheerful way...\\n\\n\"You haf a fine day to make your walk.  Bon voyage, Mademoiselle.\"\\n\\nI laughed all the way downstairs, but it was a little pathetic, also to\\nthink of the poor man having to mend his own clothes. The German\\ngentlemen embroider, I know, but darning hose is another thing and not\\nso pretty.\\n\\n\\nSaturday\\n\\nNothing has happened to write about, except a call on Miss Norton, who\\nhas a room full of pretty things, and who was very charming, for she\\nshowed me all her treasures, and asked me if I would sometimes go with\\nher to lectures and concerts, as her escort, if I enjoyed them.  She\\nput it as a favor, but I\\'m sure Mrs. Kirke has told her about us, and\\nshe does it out of kindness to me.  I\\'m as proud as Lucifer, but such\\nfavors from such people don\\'t burden me, and I accepted gratefully.\\n\\nWhen I got back to the nursery there was such an uproar in the parlor\\nthat I looked in, and there was Mr. Bhaer down on his hands and knees,\\nwith Tina on his back, Kitty leading him with a jump rope, and Minnie\\nfeeding two small boys with seedcakes, as they roared and ramped in\\ncages built of chairs.\\n\\n\"We are playing nargerie,\" explained Kitty.\\n\\n\"Dis is mine effalunt!\" added Tina, holding on by the Professor\\'s hair.\\n\\n\"Mamma always allows us to do what we like Saturday afternoon, when\\nFranz and Emil come, doesn\\'t she, Mr. Bhaer?\" said Minnie.\\n\\nThe \\'effalunt\\' sat up, looking as much in earnest as any of them, and\\nsaid soberly to me, \"I gif you my wort it is so, if we make too large a\\nnoise you shall say Hush! to us, and we go more softly.\"\\n\\nI promised to do so, but left the door open and enjoyed the fun as much\\nas they did, for a more glorious frolic I never witnessed.  They played\\ntag and soldiers, danced and sang, and when it began to grow dark they\\nall piled onto the sofa about the Professor, while he told charming\\nfairy stories of the storks on the chimney tops, and the little\\n\\'koblods\\', who ride the snowflakes as they fall.  I wish Americans were\\nas simple and natural as Germans, don\\'t you?\\n\\nI\\'m so fond of writing, I should go spinning on forever if motives of\\neconomy didn\\'t stop me, for though I\\'ve used thin paper and written\\nfine, I tremble to think of the stamps this long letter will need.\\nPray forward Amy\\'s as soon as you can spare them.  My small news will\\nsound very flat after her splendors, but you will like them, I know.\\nIs Teddy studying so hard that he can\\'t find time to write to his\\nfriends?  Take good care of him for me, Beth, and tell me all about the\\nbabies, and give heaps of love to everyone.  From your faithful Jo.\\n\\nP.S.  On reading over my letter, it strikes me as rather Bhaery, but I\\nam always interested in odd people, and I really had nothing else to\\nwrite about.  Bless you!\\n\\nDECEMBER\\n\\nMy Precious Betsey,\\n\\nAs this is to be a scribble-scrabble letter, I direct it to you, for it\\nmay amuse you, and give you some idea of my goings on, for though\\nquiet, they are rather amusing, for which, oh, be joyful!  After what\\nAmy would call Herculaneum efforts, in the way of mental and moral\\nagriculture, my young ideas begin to shoot and my little twigs to bend\\nas I could wish.  They are not so interesting to me as Tina and the\\nboys, but I do my duty by them, and they are fond of me.  Franz and\\nEmil are jolly little lads, quite after my own heart, for the mixture\\nof German and American spirit in them produces a constant state of\\neffervescence.  Saturday afternoons are riotous times, whether spent in\\nthe house or out, for on pleasant days they all go to walk, like a\\nseminary, with the Professor and myself to keep order, and then such\\nfun!\\n\\nWe are very good friends now, and I\\'ve begun to take lessons.  I really\\ncouldn\\'t help it, and it all came about in such a droll way that I must\\ntell you.  To begin at the beginning, Mrs. Kirke called to me one day\\nas I passed Mr. Bhaer\\'s room where she was rummaging.\\n\\n\"Did you ever see such a den, my dear?  Just come and help me put these\\nbooks to rights, for I\\'ve turned everything upside down, trying to\\ndiscover what he has done with the six new handkerchiefs I gave him not\\nlong ago.\"\\n\\nI went in, and while we worked I looked about me, for it was \\'a den\\' to\\nbe sure.  Books and papers everywhere, a broken meerschaum, and an old\\nflute over the mantlepiece as if done with, a ragged bird without any\\ntail chirped on one window seat, and a box of white mice adorned the\\nother.  Half-finished boats and bits of string lay among the\\nmanuscripts.  Dirty little boots stood drying before the fire, and\\ntraces of the dearly beloved boys, for whom he makes a slave of\\nhimself, were to be seen all over the room.  After a grand rummage\\nthree of the missing articles were found, one over the bird cage, one\\ncovered with ink, and a third burned brown, having been used as a\\nholder.\\n\\n\"Such a man!\" laughed good-natured Mrs. K., as she put the relics in\\nthe rag bag.  \"I suppose the others are torn up to rig ships, bandage\\ncut fingers, or make kite tails.  It\\'s dreadful, but I can\\'t scold him.\\nHe\\'s so absent-minded and goodnatured, he lets those boys ride over him\\nroughshod.  I agreed to do his washing and mending, but he forgets to\\ngive out his things and I forget to look them over, so he comes to a\\nsad pass sometimes.\"\\n\\n\"Let me mend them,\" said I.  \"I don\\'t mind it, and he needn\\'t know.\\nI\\'d like to, he\\'s so kind to me about bringing my letters and lending\\nbooks.\"\\n\\nSo I have got his things in order, and knit heels into two pairs of the\\nsocks, for they were boggled out of shape with his queer darns.\\nNothing was said, and I hoped he wouldn\\'t find it out, but one day last\\nweek he caught me at it.  Hearing the lessons he gives to others has\\ninterested and amused me so much that I took a fancy to learn, for Tina\\nruns in and out, leaving the door open, and I can hear.  I had been\\nsitting near this door, finishing off the last sock, and trying to\\nunderstand what he said to a new scholar, who is as stupid as I am.\\nThe girl had gone, and I thought he had also, it was so still, and I\\nwas busily gabbling over a verb, and rocking to and fro in a most\\nabsurd way, when a little crow made me look up, and there was Mr. Bhaer\\nlooking and laughing quietly, while he made signs to Tina not to betray\\nhim.\\n\\n\"So!\" he said, as I stopped and stared like a goose, \"you peep at me, I\\npeep at you, and this is not bad, but see, I am not pleasanting when I\\nsay, haf you a wish for German?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but you are too busy.  I am too stupid to learn,\" I blundered\\nout, as red as a peony.\\n\\n\"Prut!  We will make the time, and we fail not to find the sense.  At\\nefening I shall gif a little lesson with much gladness, for look you,\\nMees Marsch, I haf this debt to pay.\"  And he pointed to my work \\'Yes,\\'\\nthey say to one another, these so kind ladies, \\'he is a stupid old\\nfellow, he will see not what we do, he will never observe that his sock\\nheels go not in holes any more, he will think his buttons grow out new\\nwhen they fall, and believe that strings make theirselves.\\' \"Ah!  But I\\nhaf an eye, and I see much.  I haf a heart, and I feel thanks for this.\\nCome, a little lesson then and now, or--no more good fairy works for me\\nand mine.\"\\n\\nOf course I couldn\\'t say anything after that, and as it really is a\\nsplendid opportunity, I made the bargain, and we began.  I took four\\nlessons, and then I stuck fast in a grammatical bog.  The Professor was\\nvery patient with me, but it must have been torment to him, and now and\\nthen he\\'d look at me with such an expression of mild despair that it\\nwas a toss-up with me whether to laugh or cry.  I tried both ways, and\\nwhen it came to a sniff or utter mortification and woe, he just threw\\nthe grammar on to the floor and marched out of the room. I felt myself\\ndisgraced and deserted forever, but didn\\'t blame him a particle, and\\nwas scrambling my papers together, meaning to rush upstairs and shake\\nmyself hard, when in he came, as brisk and beaming as if I\\'d covered\\nmyself in glory.\\n\\n\"Now we shall try a new way.  You and I will read these pleasant little\\n_marchen_ together, and dig no more in that dry book, that goes in the\\ncorner for making us trouble.\"\\n\\nHe spoke so kindly, and opened Hans Anderson\\'s fairy tales so\\ninvitingly before me, that I was more ashamed than ever, and went at my\\nlesson in a neck-or-nothing style that seemed to amuse him immensely.\\nI forgot my bashfulness, and pegged away (no other word will express\\nit) with all my might, tumbling over long words, pronouncing according\\nto inspiration of the minute, and doing my very best.  When I finished\\nreading my first page, and stopped for breath, he clapped his hands and\\ncried out in his hearty way, \"Das ist gut! Now we go well!  My turn.  I\\ndo him in German, gif me your ear.\"  And away he went, rumbling out the\\nwords with his strong voice and a relish which was good to see as well\\nas hear.  Fortunately the story was _The Constant Tin Soldier_, which\\nis droll, you know, so I could laugh, and I did, though I didn\\'t\\nunderstand half he read, for I couldn\\'t help it, he was so earnest, I\\nso excited, and the whole thing so comical.\\n\\nAfter that we got on better, and now I read my lessons pretty well, for\\nthis way of studying suits me, and I can see that the grammar gets\\ntucked into the tales and poetry as one gives pills in jelly.  I like\\nit very much, and he doesn\\'t seem tired of it yet, which is very good\\nof him, isn\\'t it?  I mean to give him something on Christmas, for I\\ndare not offer money. Tell me something nice, Marmee.\\n\\nI\\'m glad Laurie seems so happy and busy, that he has given up smoking\\nand lets his hair grow.  You see Beth manages him better than I did.\\nI\\'m not jealous, dear, do your best, only don\\'t make a saint of him.\\nI\\'m afraid I couldn\\'t like him without a spice of human naughtiness.\\nRead him bits of my letters.  I haven\\'t time to write much, and that\\nwill do just as well.  Thank Heaven Beth continues so comfortable.\\n\\nJANUARY\\n\\nA Happy New Year to you all, my dearest family, which of course\\nincludes Mr. L.  and a young man by the name of Teddy. I can\\'t tell you\\nhow much I enjoyed your Christmas bundle, for I didn\\'t get it till\\nnight and had given up hoping.  Your letter came in the morning, but\\nyou said nothing about a parcel, meaning it for a surprise, so I was\\ndisappointed, for I\\'d had a \\'kind of feeling\\' that you wouldn\\'t forget\\nme. I felt a little low in my mind as I sat up in my room after tea,\\nand when the big, muddy, battered-looking bundle was brought to me, I\\njust hugged it and pranced.  It was so homey and refreshing that I sat\\ndown on the floor and read and looked and ate and laughed and cried, in\\nmy usual absurd way.  The things were just what I wanted, and all the\\nbetter for being made instead of bought.  Beth\\'s new \\'ink bib\\' was\\ncapital, and Hannah\\'s box of hard gingerbread will be a treasure.  I\\'ll\\nbe sure and wear the nice flannels you sent, Marmee, and read carefully\\nthe books Father has marked.  Thank you all, heaps and heaps!\\n\\nSpeaking of books reminds me that I\\'m getting rich in that line, for on\\nNew Year\\'s Day Mr. Bhaer gave me a fine Shakespeare. It is one he\\nvalues much, and I\\'ve often admired it, set up in the place of honor\\nwith his German Bible, Plato, Homer, and Milton, so you may imagine how\\nI felt when he brought it down, without its cover, and showed me my own\\nname in it, \"from my friend Friedrich Bhaer\".\\n\\n\"You say often you wish a library.  Here I gif you one, for between\\nthese lids (he meant covers) is many books in one.  Read him well, and\\nhe will help you much, for the study of character in this book will\\nhelp you to read it in the world and paint it with your pen.\"\\n\\nI thanked him as well as I could, and talk now about \\'my library\\', as\\nif I had a hundred books.  I never knew how much there was in\\nShakespeare before, but then I never had a Bhaer to explain it to me.\\nNow don\\'t laugh at his horrid name.  It isn\\'t pronounced either Bear or\\nBeer, as people will say it, but something between the two, as only\\nGermans can give it. I\\'m glad you both like what I tell you about him,\\nand hope you will know him some day.  Mother would admire his warm\\nheart, Father his wise head.  I admire both, and feel rich in my new\\n\\'friend Friedrich Bhaer\\'.\\n\\nNot having much money, or knowing what he\\'d like, I got several little\\nthings, and put them about the room, where he would find them\\nunexpectedly.  They were useful, pretty, or funny, a new standish on\\nhis table, a little vase for his flower, he always has one, or a bit of\\ngreen in a glass, to keep him fresh, he says, and a holder for his\\nblower, so that he needn\\'t burn up what Amy calls \\'mouchoirs\\'.  I made\\nit like those Beth invented, a big butterfly with a fat body, and black\\nand yellow wings, worsted feelers, and bead eyes. It took his fancy\\nimmensely, and he put it on his mantlepiece as an article of virtue, so\\nit was rather a failure after all. Poor as he is, he didn\\'t forget a\\nservant or a child in the house, and not a soul here, from the French\\nlaundrywoman to Miss Norton forgot him.  I was so glad of that.\\n\\nThey got up a masquerade, and had a gay time New Year\\'s Eve.  I didn\\'t\\nmean to go down, having no dress.  But at the last minute, Mrs. Kirke\\nremembered some old brocades, and Miss Norton lent me lace and\\nfeathers.  So I dressed up as Mrs. Malaprop, and sailed in with a mask\\non.  No one knew me, for I disguised my voice, and no one dreamed of\\nthe silent, haughty Miss March (for they think I am very stiff and\\ncool, most of them, and so I am to whippersnappers) could dance and\\ndress, and burst out into a \\'nice derangement of epitaphs, like an\\nallegory on the banks of the Nile\\'.  I enjoyed it very much, and when\\nwe unmasked it was fun to see them stare at me.  I heard one of the\\nyoung men tell another that he knew I\\'d been an actress, in fact, he\\nthought he remembered seeing me at one of the minor theaters.  Meg will\\nrelish that joke.  Mr. Bhaer was Nick Bottom, and Tina was Titania, a\\nperfect little fairy in his arms.  To see them dance was \\'quite a\\nlandscape\\', to use a Teddyism.\\n\\nI had a very happy New Year, after all, and when I thought it over in\\nmy room, I felt as if I was getting on a little in spite of my many\\nfailures, for I\\'m cheerful all the time now, work with a will, and take\\nmore interest in other people than I used to, which is satisfactory.\\nBless you all!  Ever your loving...  Jo\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'THIRTY-FOUR\\n\\nFRIEND\\n\\nThough very happy in the social atmosphere about her, and very busy\\nwith the daily work that earned her bread and made it sweeter for the\\neffort, Jo still found time for literary labors.  The purpose which now\\ntook possession of her was a natural one to a poor and ambitious girl,\\nbut the means she took to gain her end were not the best.  She saw that\\nmoney conferred power, money and power, therefore, she resolved to\\nhave, not to be used for herself alone, but for those whom she loved\\nmore than life.  The dream of filling home with comforts, giving Beth\\neverything she wanted, from strawberries in winter to an organ in her\\nbedroom, going abroad herself, and always having more than enough, so\\nthat she might indulge in the luxury of charity, had been for years\\nJo\\'s most cherished castle in the air.\\n\\nThe prize-story experience had seemed to open a way which might, after\\nlong traveling and much uphill work, lead to this delightful chateau en\\nEspagne.  But the novel disaster quenched her courage for a time, for\\npublic opinion is a giant which has frightened stouter-hearted Jacks on\\nbigger beanstalks than hers. Like that immortal hero, she reposed\\nawhile after the first attempt, which resulted in a tumble and the\\nleast lovely of the giant\\'s treasures, if I remember rightly.  But the\\n\\'up again and take another\\' spirit was as strong in Jo as in Jack, so\\nshe scrambled up on the shady side this time and got more booty, but\\nnearly left behind her what was far more precious than the moneybags.\\n\\nShe took to writing sensation stories, for in those dark ages, even\\nall-perfect America read rubbish.  She told no one, but concocted a\\n\\'thrilling tale\\', and boldly carried it herself to Mr. Dashwood, editor\\nof the Weekly Volcano.  She had never read Sartor Resartus, but she had\\na womanly instinct that clothes possess an influence more powerful over\\nmany than the worth of character or the magic of manners.  So she\\ndressed herself in her best, and trying to persuade herself that she\\nwas neither excited nor nervous, bravely climbed two pairs of dark and\\ndirty stairs to find herself in a disorderly room, a cloud of cigar\\nsmoke, and the presence of three gentlemen, sitting with their heels\\nrather higher than their hats, which articles of dress none of them\\ntook the trouble to remove on her appearance.  Somewhat daunted by this\\nreception, Jo hesitated on the threshold, murmuring in much\\nembarrassment...\\n\\n\"Excuse me, I was looking for the Weekly Volcano office. I wished to\\nsee Mr. Dashwood.\"\\n\\nDown went the highest pair of heels, up rose the smokiest gentleman,\\nand carefully cherishing his cigar between his fingers, he advanced\\nwith a nod and a countenance expressive of nothing but sleep.  Feeling\\nthat she must get through the matter somehow, Jo produced her\\nmanuscript and, blushing redder and redder with each sentence,\\nblundered out fragments of the little speech carefully prepared for the\\noccasion.\\n\\n\"A friend of mine desired me to offer--a story--just as an\\nexperiment--would like your opinion--be glad to write more if this\\nsuits.\"\\n\\nWhile she blushed and blundered, Mr. Dashwood had taken the manuscript,\\nand was turning over the leaves with a pair of rather dirty fingers,\\nand casting critical glances up and down the neat pages.\\n\\n\"Not a first attempt, I take it?\" observing that the pages were\\nnumbered, covered only on one side, and not tied up with a ribbon--sure\\nsign of a novice.\\n\\n\"No, sir.  She has had some experience, and got a prize for a tale in\\nthe _Blarneystone Banner_.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, did she?\" and Mr. Dashwood gave Jo a quick look, which seemed to\\ntake note of everything she had on, from the bow in her bonnet to the\\nbuttons on her boots.  \"Well, you can leave it, if you like.  We\\'ve\\nmore of this sort of thing on hand than we know what to do with at\\npresent, but I\\'ll run my eye over it, and give you an answer next week.\"\\n\\nNow, Jo did _not_ like to leave it, for Mr. Dashwood didn\\'t suit her at\\nall, but, under the circumstances, there was nothing for her to do but\\nbow and walk away, looking particularly tall and dignified, as she was\\napt to do when nettled or abashed. Just then she was both, for it was\\nperfectly evident from the knowing glances exchanged among the\\ngentlemen that her little fiction of \\'my friend\\' was considered a good\\njoke, and a laugh, produced by some inaudible remark of the editor, as\\nhe closed the door, completed her discomfiture.  Half resolving never\\nto return, she went home, and worked off her irritation by stitching\\npinafores vigorously, and in an hour or two was cool enough to laugh\\nover the scene and long for next week.\\n\\nWhen she went again, Mr. Dashwood was alone, whereat she rejoiced.  Mr.\\nDashwood was much wider awake than before, which was agreeable, and Mr.\\nDashwood was not too deeply absorbed in a cigar to remember his\\nmanners, so the second interview was much more comfortable than the\\nfirst.\\n\\n\"We\\'ll take this (editors never say I), if you don\\'t object to a few\\nalterations.  It\\'s too long, but omitting the passages I\\'ve marked will\\nmake it just the right length,\" he said, in a businesslike tone.\\n\\nJo hardly knew her own MS.  again, so crumpled and underscored were its\\npages and paragraphs, but feeling as a tender parent might on being\\nasked to cut off her baby\\'s legs in order that it might fit into a new\\ncradle, she looked at the marked passages and was surprised to find\\nthat all the moral reflections--which she had carefully put in as\\nballast for much romance--had been stricken out.\\n\\n\"But, Sir, I thought every story should have some sort of a moral, so I\\ntook care to have a few of my sinners repent.\"\\n\\nMr. Dashwoods\\'s editorial gravity relaxed into a smile, for Jo had\\nforgotten her \\'friend\\', and spoken as only an author could.\\n\\n\"People want to be amused, not preached at, you know.  Morals don\\'t\\nsell nowadays.\"  Which was not quite a correct statement, by the way.\\n\\n\"You think it would do with these alterations, then?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, it\\'s a new plot, and pretty well worked up--language good, and so\\non,\" was Mr. Dashwood\\'s affable reply.\\n\\n\"What do you--that is, what compensation--\" began Jo, not exactly\\nknowing how to express herself.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, well, we give from twenty-five to thirty for things of this\\nsort.  Pay when it comes out,\" returned Mr. Dashwood, as if that point\\nhad escaped him.  Such trifles do escape the editorial mind, it is said.\\n\\n\"Very well, you can have it,\" said Jo, handing back the story with a\\nsatisfied air, for after the dollar-a-column work, even twenty-five\\nseemed good pay.\\n\\n\"Shall I tell my friend you will take another if she has one better\\nthan this?\" asked Jo, unconscious of her little slip of the tongue, and\\nemboldened by her success.\\n\\n\"Well, we\\'ll look at it.  Can\\'t promise to take it.  Tell her to make\\nit short and spicy, and never mind the moral.  What name would your\\nfriend like to put on it?\" in a careless tone.\\n\\n\"None at all, if you please, she doesn\\'t wish her name to appear and\\nhas no nom de plume,\" said Jo, blushing in spite of herself.\\n\\n\"Just as she likes, of course.  The tale will be out next week. Will\\nyou call for the money, or shall I send it?\" asked Mr. Dashwood, who\\nfelt a natural desire to know who his new contributor might be.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll call.  Good morning, Sir.\"\\n\\nAs she departed, Mr. Dashwood put up his feet, with the graceful\\nremark, \"Poor and proud, as usual, but she\\'ll do.\"\\n\\nFollowing Mr. Dashwood\\'s directions, and making Mrs. Northbury her\\nmodel, Jo rashly took a plunge into the frothy sea of sensational\\nliterature, but thanks to the life preserver thrown her by a friend,\\nshe came up again not much the worse for her ducking.\\n\\nLike most young scribblers, she went abroad for her characters and\\nscenery, and banditti, counts, gypsies, nuns, and duchesses appeared\\nupon her stage, and played their parts with as much accuracy and spirit\\nas could be expected.  Her readers were not particular about such\\ntrifles as grammar, punctuation, and probability, and Mr. Dashwood\\ngraciously permitted her to fill his columns at the lowest prices, not\\nthinking it necessary to tell her that the real cause of his\\nhospitality was the fact that one of his hacks, on being offered higher\\nwages, had basely left him in the lurch.\\n\\nShe soon became interested in her work, for her emaciated purse grew\\nstout, and the little hoard she was making to take Beth to the\\nmountains next summer grew slowly but surely as the weeks passed.  One\\nthing disturbed her satisfaction, and that was that she did not tell\\nthem at home.  She had a feeling that Father and Mother would not\\napprove, and preferred to have her own way first, and beg pardon\\nafterward.  It was easy to keep her secret, for no name appeared with\\nher stories.  Mr. Dashwood had of course found it out very soon, but\\npromised to be dumb, and for a wonder kept his word.\\n\\nShe thought it would do her no harm, for she sincerely meant to write\\nnothing of which she would be ashamed, and quieted all pricks of\\nconscience by anticipations of the happy minute when she should show\\nher earnings and laugh over her well-kept secret.\\n\\nBut Mr. Dashwood rejected any but thrilling tales, and as thrills could\\nnot be produced except by harrowing up the souls of the readers,\\nhistory and romance, land and sea, science and art, police records and\\nlunatic asylums, had to be ransacked for the purpose.  Jo soon found\\nthat her innocent experience had given her but few glimpses of the\\ntragic world which underlies society, so regarding it in a business\\nlight, she set about supplying her deficiencies with characteristic\\nenergy. Eager to find material for stories, and bent on making them\\noriginal in plot, if not masterly in execution, she searched newspapers\\nfor accidents, incidents, and crimes.  She excited the suspicions of\\npublic librarians by asking for works on poisons.  She studied faces in\\nthe street, and characters, good, bad, and indifferent, all about her.\\nShe delved in the dust of ancient times for facts or fictions so old\\nthat they were as good as new, and introduced herself to folly, sin,\\nand misery, as well as her limited opportunities allowed.  She thought\\nshe was prospering finely, but unconsciously she was beginning to\\ndesecrate some of the womanliest attributes of a woman\\'s character.\\nShe was living in bad society, and imaginary though it was, its\\ninfluence affected her, for she was feeding heart and fancy on\\ndangerous and unsubstantial food, and was fast brushing the innocent\\nbloom from her nature by a premature acquaintance with the darker side\\nof life, which comes soon enough to all of us.\\n\\nShe was beginning to feel rather than see this, for much describing of\\nother people\\'s passions and feelings set her to studying and\\nspeculating about her own, a morbid amusement in which healthy young\\nminds do not voluntarily indulge. Wrongdoing always brings its own\\npunishment, and when Jo most needed hers, she got it.\\n\\nI don\\'t know whether the study of Shakespeare helped her to read\\ncharacter, or the natural instinct of a woman for what was honest,\\nbrave, and strong, but while endowing her imaginary heroes with every\\nperfection under the sun, Jo was discovering a live hero, who\\ninterested her in spite of many human imperfections.  Mr. Bhaer, in one\\nof their conversations, had advised her to study simple, true, and\\nlovely characters, wherever she found them, as good training for a\\nwriter.  Jo took him at his word, for she coolly turned round and\\nstudied him--a proceeding which would have much surprised him, had he\\nknown it, for the worthy Professor was very humble in his own conceit.\\n\\nWhy everybody liked him was what puzzled Jo, at first.  He was neither\\nrich nor great, young nor handsome, in no respect what is called\\nfascinating, imposing, or brilliant, and yet he was as attractive as a\\ngenial fire, and people seemed to gather about him as naturally as\\nabout a warm hearth.  He was poor, yet always appeared to be giving\\nsomething away; a stranger, yet everyone was his friend; no longer\\nyoung, but as happy-hearted as a boy; plain and peculiar, yet his face\\nlooked beautiful to many, and his oddities were freely forgiven for his\\nsake.  Jo often watched him, trying to discover the charm, and at last\\ndecided that it was benevolence which worked the miracle.  If he had\\nany sorrow, \\'it sat with its head under its wing\\', and he turned only\\nhis sunny side to the world.  There were lines upon his forehead, but\\nTime seemed to have touched him gently, remembering how kind he was to\\nothers.  The pleasant curves about his mouth were the memorials of many\\nfriendly words and cheery laughs, his eyes were never cold or hard, and\\nhis big hand had a warm, strong grasp that was more expressive than\\nwords.\\n\\nHis very clothes seemed to partake of the hospitable nature of the\\nwearer.  They looked as if they were at ease, and liked to make him\\ncomfortable.  His capacious waistcoat was suggestive of a large heart\\nunderneath.  His rusty coat had a social air, and the baggy pockets\\nplainly proved that little hands often went in empty and came out full.\\nHis very boots were benevolent, and his collars never stiff and raspy\\nlike other people\\'s.\\n\\n\"That\\'s it!\" said Jo to herself, when she at length discovered that\\ngenuine good will toward one\\'s fellow men could beautify and dignify\\neven a stout German teacher, who shoveled in his dinner, darned his own\\nsocks, and was burdened with the name of Bhaer.\\n\\nJo valued goodness highly, but she also possessed a most feminine\\nrespect for intellect, and a little discovery which she made about the\\nProfessor added much to her regard for him. He never spoke of himself,\\nand no one ever knew that in his native city he had been a man much\\nhonored and esteemed for learning and integrity, till a countryman came\\nto see him. He never spoke of himself, and in a conversation with Miss\\nNorton divulged the pleasing fact.  From her Jo learned it, and liked\\nit all the better because Mr. Bhaer had never told it.  She felt proud\\nto know that he was an honored Professor in Berlin, though only a poor\\nlanguage-master in America, and his homely, hard-working life was much\\nbeautified by the spice of romance which this discovery gave it.\\nAnother and a better gift than intellect was shown her in a most\\nunexpected manner.  Miss Norton had the entree into most society, which\\nJo would have had no chance of seeing but for her.  The solitary woman\\nfelt an interest in the ambitious girl, and kindly conferred many\\nfavors of this sort both on Jo and the Professor.  She took them with\\nher one night to a select symposium, held in honor of several\\ncelebrities.\\n\\nJo went prepared to bow down and adore the mighty ones whom she had\\nworshiped with youthful enthusiasm afar off.  But her reverence for\\ngenius received a severe shock that night, and it took her some time to\\nrecover from the discovery that the great creatures were only men and\\nwomen after all.  Imagine her dismay, on stealing a glance of timid\\nadmiration at the poet whose lines suggested an ethereal being fed on\\n\\'spirit, fire, and dew\\', to behold him devouring his supper with an\\nardor which flushed his intellectual countenance.  Turning as from a\\nfallen idol, she made other discoveries which rapidly dispelled her\\nromantic illusions.  The great novelist vibrated between two decanters\\nwith the regularity of a pendulum; the famous divine flirted openly\\nwith one of the Madame de Staels of the age, who looked daggers at\\nanother Corinne, who was amiably satirizing her, after outmaneuvering\\nher in efforts to absorb the profound philosopher, who imbibed tea\\nJohnsonianly and appeared to slumber, the loquacity of the lady\\nrendering speech impossible.  The scientific celebrities, forgetting\\ntheir mollusks and glacial periods, gossiped about art, while devoting\\nthemselves to oysters and ices with characteristic energy; the young\\nmusician, who was charming the city like a second Orpheus, talked\\nhorses; and the specimen of the British nobility present happened to be\\nthe most ordinary man of the party.\\n\\nBefore the evening was half over, Jo felt so completely disillusioned,\\nthat she sat down in a corner to recover herself. Mr. Bhaer soon joined\\nher, looking rather out of his element, and presently several of the\\nphilosophers, each mounted on his hobby, came ambling up to hold an\\nintellectual tournament in the recess.  The conversations were miles\\nbeyond Jo\\'s comprehension, but she enjoyed it, though Kant and Hegel\\nwere unknown gods, the Subjective and Objective unintelligible terms,\\nand the only thing \\'evolved from her inner consciousness\\' was a bad\\nheadache after it was all over.  It dawned upon her gradually that the\\nworld was being picked to pieces, and put together on new and,\\naccording to the talkers, on infinitely better principles than before,\\nthat religion was in a fair way to be reasoned into nothingness, and\\nintellect was to be the only God.  Jo knew nothing about philosophy or\\nmetaphysics of any sort, but a curious excitement, half pleasurable,\\nhalf painful, came over her as she listened with a sense of being\\nturned adrift into time and space, like a young balloon out on a\\nholiday.\\n\\nShe looked round to see how the Professor liked it, and found him\\nlooking at her with the grimmest expression she had ever seen him wear.\\nHe shook his head and beckoned her to come away, but she was fascinated\\njust then by the freedom of Speculative Philosophy, and kept her seat,\\ntrying to find out what the wise gentlemen intended to rely upon after\\nthey had annihilated all the old beliefs.\\n\\nNow, Mr. Bhaer was a diffident man and slow to offer his own opinions,\\nnot because they were unsettled, but too sincere and earnest to be\\nlightly spoken.  As he glanced from Jo to several other young people,\\nattracted by the brilliancy of the philosophic pyrotechnics, he knit\\nhis brows and longed to speak, fearing that some inflammable young soul\\nwould be led astray by the rockets, to find when the display was over\\nthat they had only an empty stick or a scorched hand.\\n\\nHe bore it as long as he could, but when he was appealed to for an\\nopinion, he blazed up with honest indignation and defended religion\\nwith all the eloquence of truth--an eloquence which made his broken\\nEnglish musical and his plain face beautiful.  He had a hard fight, for\\nthe wise men argued well, but he didn\\'t know when he was beaten and\\nstood to his colors like a man.  Somehow, as he talked, the world got\\nright again to Jo.  The old beliefs, that had lasted so long, seemed\\nbetter than the new.  God was not a blind force, and immortality was\\nnot a pretty fable, but a blessed fact.  She felt as if she had solid\\nground under her feet again, and when Mr. Bhaer paused, outtalked but\\nnot one whit convinced, Jo wanted to clap her hands and thank him.\\n\\nShe did neither, but she remembered the scene, and gave the Professor\\nher heartiest respect, for she knew it cost him an effort to speak out\\nthen and there, because his conscience would not let him be silent.\\nShe began to see that character is a better possession than money,\\nrank, intellect, or beauty, and to feel that if greatness is what a\\nwise man has defined it to be, \\'truth, reverence, and good will\\', then\\nher friend Friedrich Bhaer was not only good, but great.\\n\\nThis belief strengthened daily.  She valued his esteem, she coveted his\\nrespect, she wanted to be worthy of his friendship, and just when the\\nwish was sincerest, she came near to losing everything.  It all grew\\nout of a cocked hat, for one evening the Professor came in to give Jo\\nher lesson with a paper soldier cap on his head, which Tina had put\\nthere and he had forgotten to take off.\\n\\n\"It\\'s evident he doesn\\'t look in his glass before coming down,\" thought\\nJo, with a smile, as he said \"Goot efening,\" and sat soberly down,\\nquite unconscious of the ludicrous contrast between his subject and his\\nheadgear, for he was going to read her the Death of Wallenstein.\\n\\nShe said nothing at first, for she liked to hear him laugh out his big,\\nhearty laugh when anything funny happened, so she left him to discover\\nit for himself, and presently forgot all about it, for to hear a German\\nread Schiller is rather an absorbing occupation.  After the reading\\ncame the lesson, which was a lively one, for Jo was in a gay mood that\\nnight, and the cocked hat kept her eyes dancing with merriment.  The\\nProfessor didn\\'t know what to make of her, and stopped at last to ask\\nwith an air of mild surprise that was irresistible. . .\\n\\n\"Mees Marsch, for what do you laugh in your master\\'s face? Haf you no\\nrespect for me, that you go on so bad?\"\\n\\n\"How can I be respectful, Sir, when you forget to take your hat off?\"\\nsaid Jo.\\n\\nLifting his hand to his head, the absent-minded Professor gravely felt\\nand removed the little cocked hat, looked at it a minute, and then\\nthrew back his head and laughed like a merry bass viol.\\n\\n\"Ah!  I see him now, it is that imp Tina who makes me a fool with my\\ncap.  Well, it is nothing, but see you, if this lesson goes not well,\\nyou too shall wear him.\"\\n\\nBut the lesson did not go at all for a few minutes because Mr. Bhaer\\ncaught sight of a picture on the hat, and unfolding it, said with great\\ndisgust, \"I wish these papers did not come in the house.  They are not\\nfor children to see,  nor young people to read. It is not well, and I\\nhaf no patience with those who make this harm.\"\\n\\nJo glanced at the sheet and saw a pleasing illustration composed of a\\nlunatic, a corpse, a villain, and a viper.  She did not like it, but\\nthe impulse that made her turn it over was not one of displeasure but\\nfear, because for a minute she fancied the paper was the Volcano.  It\\nwas not, however, and her panic subsided as she remembered that even if\\nit had been and one of her own tales in it, there would have been no\\nname to betray her.  She had betrayed herself, however, by a look and a\\nblush, for though an absent man, the Professor saw a good deal more\\nthan people fancied.  He knew that Jo wrote, and had met her down among\\nthe newspaper offices more than once, but as she never spoke of it, he\\nasked no questions in spite of a strong desire to see her work.  Now it\\noccurred to him that she was doing what she was ashamed to own, and it\\ntroubled him.  He did not say to himself, \"It is none of my business.\\nI\\'ve no right to say anything,\" as many people would have done.  He\\nonly remembered that she was young and poor, a girl far away from\\nmother\\'s love and father\\'s care, and he was moved to help her with an\\nimpulse as quick and natural as that which would prompt him to put out\\nhis hand to save a baby from a puddle.  All this flashed through his\\nmind in a minute, but not a trace of it appeared in his face, and by\\nthe time the paper was turned, and Jo\\'s needle threaded, he was ready\\nto say quite naturally, but very gravely...\\n\\n\"Yes, you are right to put it from you.  I do not think that good young\\ngirls should see such things.  They are made pleasant to some, but I\\nwould more rather give my boys gunpowder to play with than this bad\\ntrash.\"\\n\\n\"All may not be bad, only silly, you know, and if there is a demand for\\nit, I don\\'t see any harm in supplying it. Many very respectable people\\nmake an honest living out of what are called sensation stories,\" said\\nJo, scratching gathers so energetically that a row of little slits\\nfollowed her pin.\\n\\n\"There is a demand for whisky, but I think you and I do not care to\\nsell it.  If the respectable people knew what harm they did, they would\\nnot feel that the living was honest.  They haf no right to put poison\\nin the sugarplum, and let the small ones eat it.  No, they should think\\na little, and sweep mud in the street before they do this thing.\"\\n\\nMr. Bhaer spoke warmly, and walked to the fire, crumpling the paper in\\nhis hands.  Jo sat still, looking as if the fire had come to her, for\\nher cheeks burned long after the cocked hat had turned to smoke and\\ngone harmlessly up the chimney.\\n\\n\"I should like much to send all the rest after him,\" muttered the\\nProfessor, coming back with a relieved air.\\n\\nJo thought what a blaze her pile of papers upstairs would make, and her\\nhard-earned money lay rather heavily on her conscience at that minute.\\nThen she thought consolingly to herself, \"Mine are not like that, they\\nare only silly, never bad, so I won\\'t be worried,\" and taking up her\\nbook, she said, with a studious face, \"Shall we go on, Sir? I\\'ll be\\nvery good and proper now.\"\\n\\n\"I shall hope so,\" was all he said, but he meant more than she\\nimagined, and the grave, kind look he gave her made her feel as if the\\nwords Weekly Volcano were printed in large type on her forehead.\\n\\nAs soon as she went to her room, she got out her papers, and carefully\\nreread every one of her stories.  Being a little shortsighted, Mr.\\nBhaer sometimes used eye glasses, and Jo had tried them once, smiling\\nto see how they magnified the fine print of her book.  Now she seemed\\nto have on the Professor\\'s mental or moral spectacles also, for the\\nfaults of these poor stories glared at her dreadfully and filled her\\nwith dismay.\\n\\n\"They are trash, and will soon be worse trash if I go on, for each is\\nmore sensational than the last.  I\\'ve gone blindly on, hurting myself\\nand other people, for the sake of money.  I know it\\'s so, for I can\\'t\\nread this stuff in sober earnest without being horribly ashamed of it,\\nand what should I do if they were seen at home or Mr. Bhaer got hold of\\nthem?\"\\n\\nJo turned hot at the bare idea, and stuffed the whole bundle into her\\nstove, nearly setting the chimney afire with the blaze.\\n\\n\"Yes, that\\'s the best place for such inflammable nonsense. I\\'d better\\nburn the house down, I suppose, than let other people blow themselves\\nup with my gunpowder,\" she thought as she watched the Demon of the Jura\\nwhisk away, a little black cinder with fiery eyes.\\n\\nBut when nothing remained of all her three month\\'s work except a heap\\nof ashes and the money in her lap, Jo looked sober, as she sat on the\\nfloor, wondering what she ought to do about her wages.\\n\\n\"I think I haven\\'t done much harm yet, and may keep this to pay for my\\ntime,\" she said, after a long meditation, adding impatiently, \"I almost\\nwish I hadn\\'t any conscience, it\\'s so inconvenient.  If I didn\\'t care\\nabout doing right, and didn\\'t feel uncomfortable when doing wrong, I\\nshould get on capitally. I can\\'t help wishing sometimes, that Mother\\nand Father hadn\\'t been so particular about such things.\"\\n\\nAh, Jo, instead of wishing that, thank God that \\'Father and Mother were\\nparticular\\', and pity from your heart those who have no such guardians\\nto hedge them round with principles which may seem like prison walls to\\nimpatient youth, but which will prove sure foundations to build\\ncharacter upon in womanhood.\\n\\nJo wrote no more sensational stories, deciding that the money did not\\npay for her share of the sensation, but going to the other extreme, as\\nis the way with people of her stamp, she took a course of Mrs.\\nSherwood, Miss Edgeworth, and Hannah More, and then produced a tale\\nwhich might have been more properly called an essay or a sermon, so\\nintensely moral was it.  She had her doubts about it from the\\nbeginning, for her lively fancy and girlish romance felt as ill at ease\\nin the new style as she would have done masquerading in the stiff and\\ncumbrous costume of the last century.  She sent this didactic gem to\\nseveral markets, but it found no purchaser, and she was inclined to\\nagree with Mr. Dashwood that morals didn\\'t sell.\\n\\nThen she tried a child\\'s story, which she could easily have disposed of\\nif she had not been mercenary enough to demand filthy lucre for it.\\nThe only person who offered enough to make it worth her while to try\\njuvenile literature was a worthy gentleman who felt it his mission to\\nconvert all the world to his particular belief.  But much as she liked\\nto write for children, Jo could not consent to depict all her naughty\\nboys as being eaten by bears or tossed by mad bulls because they did\\nnot go to a particular Sabbath school, nor all the good infants who did\\ngo as rewarded by every kind of bliss, from gilded gingerbread to\\nescorts of angels when they departed this life with psalms or sermons\\non their lisping tongues.  So nothing came of these trials, and Jo\\ncorked up her inkstand, and said in a fit of very wholesome humility...\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know anything.  I\\'ll wait until I do before I try again, and\\nmeantime, \\'sweep mud in the street\\' if I can\\'t do better, that\\'s\\nhonest, at least.\"  Which decision proved that her second tumble down\\nthe beanstalk had done her some good.\\n\\nWhile these internal revolutions were going on, her external life had\\nbeen as busy and uneventful as usual, and if she sometimes looked\\nserious or a little sad no one observed it but Professor Bhaer.  He did\\nit so quietly that Jo never knew he was watching to see if she would\\naccept and profit by his reproof, but she stood the test, and he was\\nsatisfied, for though no words passed between them, he knew that she\\nhad given up writing.  Not only did he guess it by the fact that the\\nsecond finger of her right hand was no longer inky, but she spent her\\nevenings downstairs now, was met no more among newspaper offices, and\\nstudied with a dogged patience, which assured him that she was bent on\\noccupying her mind with something useful, if not pleasant.\\n\\nHe helped her in many ways, proving himself a true friend, and Jo was\\nhappy, for while her pen lay idle, she was learning other lessons\\nbesides German, and laying a foundation for the sensation story of her\\nown life.\\n\\nIt was a pleasant winter and a long one, for she did not leave Mrs.\\nKirke till June.  Everyone seemed sorry when the time came.  The\\nchildren were inconsolable, and Mr. Bhaer\\'s hair stuck straight up all\\nover his head, for he always rumpled it wildly when disturbed in mind.\\n\\n\"Going home?  Ah, you are happy that you haf a home to go in,\" he said,\\nwhen she told him, and sat silently pulling his beard in the corner,\\nwhile she held a little levee on that last evening.\\n\\nShe was going early, so she bade them all goodbye overnight, and when\\nhis turn came, she said warmly, \"Now, Sir, you won\\'t forget to come and\\nsee us, if you ever travel our way, will you? I\\'ll never forgive you if\\nyou do, for I want them all to know my friend.\"\\n\\n\"Do you?  Shall I come?\" he asked, looking down at her with an eager\\nexpression which she did not see.\\n\\n\"Yes, come next month.  Laurie graduates then, and you\\'d enjoy\\ncommencement as something new.\"\\n\\n\"That is your best friend, of whom you speak?\" he said in an altered\\ntone.\\n\\n\"Yes, my boy Teddy.  I\\'m very proud of him and should like you to see\\nhim.\"\\n\\nJo looked up then, quite unconscious of anything but her own pleasure\\nin the prospect of showing them to one another. Something in Mr.\\nBhaer\\'s face suddenly recalled the fact that she might find Laurie more\\nthan a \\'best friend\\', and simply because she particularly wished not to\\nlook as if anything was the matter, she involuntarily began to blush,\\nand the more she tried not to, the redder she grew.  If it had not been\\nfor Tina on her knee.  She didn\\'t know what would have become of her.\\nFortunately the child was moved to hug her, so she managed to hide her\\nface an instant, hoping the Professor did not see it. But he did, and\\nhis own changed again from that momentary anxiety to its usual\\nexpression, as he said cordially...\\n\\n\"I fear I shall not make the time for that, but I wish the friend much\\nsuccess, and you all happiness.  Gott bless you!\"  And with that, he\\nshook hands warmly, shouldered Tina, and went away.\\n\\nBut after the boys were abed, he sat long before his fire with the\\ntired look on his face and the \\'heimweh\\', or homesickness, lying heavy\\nat his heart.  Once, when he remembered Jo as she sat with the little\\nchild in her lap and that new softness in her face, he leaned his head\\non his hands a minute, and then roamed about the room, as if in search\\nof something that he could not find.\\n\\n\"It is not for me, I must not hope it now,\" he said to himself, with a\\nsigh that was almost a groan.  Then, as if reproaching himself for the\\nlonging that he could not repress, he went and kissed the two tousled\\nheads upon the pillow, took down his seldom-used meerschaum, and opened\\nhis Plato.\\n\\nHe did his best and did it manfully, but I don\\'t think he found that a\\npair of rampant boys, a pipe, or even the divine Plato, were very\\nsatisfactory substitutes for wife and child at home.\\n\\nEarly as it was, he was at the station next morning to see Jo off, and\\nthanks to him, she began her solitary journey with the pleasant memory\\nof a familiar face smiling its farewell, a bunch of violets to keep her\\ncompany, and best of all, the happy thought, \"Well, the winter\\'s gone,\\nand I\\'ve written no books, earned no fortune, but I\\'ve made a friend\\nworth having and I\\'ll try to keep him all my life.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'THIRTY-FIVE\\n\\nHEARTACHE\\n\\nWhatever his motive might have been, Laurie studied to some purpose\\nthat year, for he graduated with honor, and gave the Latin oration with\\nthe grace of a Phillips and the eloquence of a Demosthenes, so his\\nfriends said.  They were all there, his grandfather--oh, so proud--Mr.\\nand Mrs. March, John and Meg, Jo and Beth, and all exulted over him\\nwith the sincere admiration which boys make light of at the time, but\\nfail to win from the world by any after-triumphs.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got to stay for this confounded supper, but I shall be home early\\ntomorrow.  You\\'ll come and meet me as usual, girls?\" Laurie said, as he\\nput the sisters into the carriage after the joys of the day were over.\\nHe said \\'girls\\', but he meant Jo, for she was the only one who kept up\\nthe old custom. She had not the heart to refuse her splendid,\\nsuccessful boy anything, and answered warmly...\\n\\n\"I\\'ll come, Teddy, rain or shine, and march before you, playing \\'Hail\\nthe conquering hero comes\\' on a jew\\'s-harp.\"\\n\\nLaurie thanked her with a look that made her think in a sudden panic,\\n\"Oh, deary me!  I know he\\'ll say something, and then what shall I do?\"\\n\\nEvening meditation and morning work somewhat allayed her fears, and\\nhaving decided that she wouldn\\'t be vain enough to think people were\\ngoing to propose when she had given them every reason to know what her\\nanswer would be, she set forth at the appointed time, hoping Teddy\\nwouldn\\'t do anything to make her hurt his poor feelings.  A call at\\nMeg\\'s, and a refreshing sniff and sip at the Daisy and Demijohn, still\\nfurther fortified her for the tete-a-tete, but when she saw a stalwart\\nfigure looming in the distance, she had a strong desire to turn about\\nand run away.\\n\\n\"Where\\'s the jew\\'s-harp, Jo?\" cried Laurie, as soon as he was within\\nspeaking distance.\\n\\n\"I forgot it.\" And Jo took heart again, for that salutation could not\\nbe called lover-like.\\n\\nShe always used to take his arm on these occasions, now she did not,\\nand he made no complaint, which was a bad sign, but talked on rapidly\\nabout all sorts of faraway subjects, till they turned from the road\\ninto the little path that led homeward through the grove.  Then he\\nwalked more slowly, suddenly lost his fine flow of language, and now\\nand then a dreadful pause occurred.  To rescue the conversation from\\none of the wells of silence into which it kept falling, Jo said\\nhastily, \"Now you must have a good long holiday!\"\\n\\n\"I intend to.\"\\n\\nSomething in his resolute tone made Jo look up quickly to find him\\nlooking down at her with an expression that assured her the dreaded\\nmoment had come, and made her put out her hand with an imploring, \"No,\\nTeddy.  Please don\\'t!\"\\n\\n\"I will, and you must hear me.  It\\'s no use, Jo, we\\'ve got to have it\\nout, and the sooner the better for both of us,\" he answered, getting\\nflushed and excited all at once.\\n\\n\"Say what you like then.  I\\'ll listen,\" said Jo, with a desperate sort\\nof patience.\\n\\nLaurie was a young lover, but he was in earnest, and meant to \\'have it\\nout\\', if he died in the attempt, so he plunged into the subject with\\ncharacteristic impetuousity, saying in a voice that would get choky now\\nand then, in spite of manful efforts to keep it steady...\\n\\n\"I\\'ve loved you ever since I\\'ve known you, Jo, couldn\\'t help it, you\\'ve\\nbeen so good to me.  I\\'ve tried to show it, but you wouldn\\'t let me.\\nNow I\\'m going to make you hear, and give me an answer, for I can\\'t go\\non so any longer.\"\\n\\n\"I wanted to save you this.  I thought you\\'d understand...\" began Jo,\\nfinding it a great deal harder than she expected.\\n\\n\"I know you did, but the girls are so queer you never know what they\\nmean.  They say no when they mean yes, and drive a man out of his wits\\njust for the fun of it,\" returned Laurie, entrenching himself behind an\\nundeniable fact.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t.  I never wanted to make you care for me so, and I went away\\nto keep you from it if I could.\"\\n\\n\"I thought so.  It was like you, but it was no use.  I only loved you\\nall the more, and I worked hard to please you, and I gave up billiards\\nand everything you didn\\'t like, and waited and never complained, for I\\nhoped you\\'d love me, though I\\'m not half good enough...\" Here there was\\na choke that couldn\\'t be controlled, so he decapitated buttercups while\\nhe cleared his \\'confounded throat\\'.\\n\\n\"You, you are, you\\'re a great deal too good for me, and I\\'m so grateful\\nto you, and so proud and fond of you, I don\\'t know why I can\\'t love you\\nas you want me to.  I\\'ve tried, but I can\\'t change the feeling, and it\\nwould be a lie to say I do when I don\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"Really, truly, Jo?\"\\n\\nHe stopped short, and caught both her hands as he put his question with\\na look that she did not soon forget.\\n\\n\"Really, truly, dear.\"\\n\\nThey were in the grove now, close by the stile, and when the last words\\nfell reluctantly from Jo\\'s lips, Laurie dropped her hands and turned as\\nif to go on, but for once in his life the fence was too much for him.\\nSo he just laid his head down on the mossy post, and stood so still\\nthat Jo was frightened.\\n\\n\"Oh, Teddy, I\\'m sorry, so desperately sorry, I could kill myself if it\\nwould do any good!  I wish you wouldn\\'t take it so hard, I can\\'t help\\nit.  You know it\\'s impossible for people to make themselves love other\\npeople if they don\\'t,\" cried Jo inelegantly but remorsefully, as she\\nsoftly patted his shoulder, remembering the time when he had comforted\\nher so long ago.\\n\\n\"They do sometimes,\" said a muffled voice from the post. \"I don\\'t\\nbelieve it\\'s the right sort of love, and I\\'d rather not try it,\" was\\nthe decided answer.\\n\\nThere was a long pause, while a blackbird sung blithely on the willow\\nby the river, and the tall grass rustled in the wind. Presently Jo said\\nvery soberly, as she sat down on the step of the stile, \"Laurie, I want\\nto tell you something.\"\\n\\nHe started as if he had been shot, threw up his head, and cried out in\\na fierce tone, \"Don\\'t tell me that, Jo, I can\\'t bear it now!\"\\n\\n\"Tell what?\" she asked, wondering at his violence.\\n\\n\"That you love that old man.\"\\n\\n\"What old man?\" demanded Jo, thinking he must mean his grandfather.\\n\\n\"That devilish Professor you were always writing about. If you say you\\nlove him, I know I shall do something desperate;\" and he looked as if\\nhe would keep his word, as he clenched his hands with a wrathful spark\\nin his eyes.\\n\\nJo wanted to laugh, but restrained herself and said warmly, for she\\ntoo, was getting excited with all this, \"Don\\'t swear, Teddy!  He isn\\'t\\nold, nor anything bad, but good and kind, and the best friend I\\'ve got,\\nnext to you.  Pray, don\\'t fly into a passion.  I want to be kind, but I\\nknow I shall get angry if you abuse my Professor.  I haven\\'t the least\\nidea of loving him or anybody else.\"\\n\\n\"But you will after a while, and then what will become of me?\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll love someone else too, like a sensible boy, and forget all this\\ntrouble.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t love anyone else, and I\\'ll never forget you, Jo, Never!\\nNever!\" with a stamp to emphasize his passionate words.\\n\\n\"What shall I do with him?\" sighed Jo, finding that emotions were more\\nunmanagable than she expected.  \"You haven\\'t heard what I wanted to\\ntell you.  Sit down and listen, for indeed I want to do right and make\\nyou happy,\" she said, hoping to soothe him with a little reason, which\\nproved that she knew nothing about love.\\n\\nSeeing a ray of hope in that last speech, Laurie threw himself down on\\nthe grass at her feet, leaned his arm on the lower step of the stile,\\nand looked up at her with an expectant face. Now that arrangement was\\nnot conducive to calm speech or clear thought on Jo\\'s part, for how\\ncould she say hard things to her boy while he watched her with eyes\\nfull of love and longing, and lashes still wet with the bitter drop or\\ntwo her hardness of heart had wrung from him?  She gently turned his\\nhead away, saying, as she stroked the wavy hair which had been allowed\\nto grow for her sake--how touching that was, to be sure! \"I agree with\\nMother that you and I are not suited to each other, because our quick\\ntempers and strong wills would probably make us very miserable, if we\\nwere so foolish as to...\" Jo paused a little over the last word, but\\nLaurie uttered it with a rapturous expression.\\n\\n\"Marry--no we shouldn\\'t!  If you loved me, Jo, I should be a perfect\\nsaint, for you could make me anything you like.\"\\n\\n\"No, I can\\'t.  I\\'ve tried and failed, and I won\\'t risk our happiness by\\nsuch a serious experiment.  We don\\'t agree and we never shall, so we\\'ll\\nbe good friends all our lives, but we won\\'t go and do anything rash.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, we will if we get the chance,\" muttered Laurie rebelliously.\\n\\n\"Now do be reasonable, and take a sensible view of the case,\" implored\\nJo, almost at her wit\\'s end.\\n\\n\"I won\\'t be reasonable.  I don\\'t want to take what you call \\'a sensible\\nview\\'.  It won\\'t help me, and it only makes it harder.  I don\\'t believe\\nyou\\'ve got any heart.\"\\n\\n\"I wish I hadn\\'t.\"\\n\\nThere was a little quiver in Jo\\'s voice, and thinking it a good omen,\\nLaurie turned round, bringing all his persuasive powers to bear as he\\nsaid, in the wheedlesome tone that had never been so dangerously\\nwheedlesome before, \"Don\\'t disappoint us, dear!  Everyone expects it.\\nGrandpa has set his heart upon it, your people like it, and I can\\'t get\\non without you.  Say you will, and let\\'s be happy.  Do, do!\"\\n\\nNot until months afterward did Jo understand how she had the strength\\nof mind to hold fast to the resolution she had made when she decided\\nthat she did not love her boy, and never could.  It was very hard to\\ndo, but she did it, knowing that delay was both useless and cruel.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t say \\'yes\\' truly, so I won\\'t say it at all.  You\\'ll see that\\nI\\'m right, by-and-by, and thank me for it...\" she began solemnly.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll be hanged if I do!\" and Laurie bounced up off the grass, burning\\nwith indignation at the very idea.\\n\\n\"Yes, you will!\" persisted Jo.  \"You\\'ll get over this after a while,\\nand find some lovely accomplished girl, who will adore you, and make a\\nfine mistress for your fine house.  I shouldn\\'t. I\\'m homely and awkward\\nand odd and old, and you\\'d be ashamed of me, and we should quarrel--we\\ncan\\'t help it even now, you see--and I shouldn\\'t like elegant society\\nand you would, and you\\'d hate my scribbling, and I couldn\\'t get on\\nwithout it, and we should be unhappy, and wish we hadn\\'t done it, and\\neverything would be horrid!\"\\n\\n\"Anything more?\" asked Laurie, finding it hard to listen patiently to\\nthis prophetic burst.\\n\\n\"Nothing more, except that I don\\'t believe I shall ever marry.  I\\'m\\nhappy as I am, and love my liberty too well to be in a hurry to give it\\nup for any mortal man.\"\\n\\n\"I know better!\" broke in Laurie.  \"You think so now, but there\\'ll come\\na time when you will care for somebody, and you\\'ll love him\\ntremendously, and live and die for him.  I know you will, it\\'s your\\nway, and I shall have to stand by and see it,\" and the despairing lover\\ncast his hat upon the ground with a gesture that would have seemed\\ncomical, if his face had not been so tragic.\\n\\n\"Yes, I will live and die for him, if he ever comes and makes me love\\nhim in spite of myself, and you must do the best you can!\" cried Jo,\\nlosing patience with poor Teddy.  \"I\\'ve done my best, but you won\\'t be\\nreasonable, and it\\'s selfish of you to keep teasing for what I can\\'t\\ngive.  I shall always be fond of you, very fond indeed, as a friend,\\nbut I\\'ll never marry you, and the sooner you believe it the better for\\nboth of us--so now!\"\\n\\nThat speech was like gunpowder.  Laurie looked at her a minute as if he\\ndid not quite know what to do with himself, then turned sharply away,\\nsaying in a desperate sort of tone, \"You\\'ll be sorry some day, Jo.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, where are you going?\" she cried, for his face frightened her.\\n\\n\"To the devil!\" was the consoling answer.\\n\\nFor a minute Jo\\'s heart stood still, as he swung himself down the bank\\ntoward the river, but it takes much folly, sin or misery to send a\\nyoung man to a violent death, and Laurie was not one of the weak sort\\nwho are conquered by a single failure.  He had no thought of a\\nmelodramatic plunge, but some blind instinct led him to fling hat and\\ncoat into his boat, and row away with all his might, making better time\\nup the river than he had done in any race.  Jo drew a long breath and\\nunclasped her hands as she watched the poor fellow trying to outstrip\\nthe trouble which he carried in his heart.\\n\\n\"That will do him good, and he\\'ll come home in such a tender, penitent\\nstate of mind, that I shan\\'t dare to see him,\" she said, adding, as she\\nwent slowly home, feeling as if she had murdered some innocent thing,\\nand buried it under the leaves.  \"Now I must go and prepare Mr.\\nLaurence to be very kind to my poor boy.  I wish he\\'d love Beth,\\nperhaps he may in time, but I begin to think I was mistaken about her.\\nOh dear!  How can girls like to have lovers and refuse them?  I think\\nit\\'s dreadful.\"\\n\\nBeing sure that no one could do it so well as herself, she went\\nstraight to Mr. Laurence, told the hard story bravely through, and then\\nbroke down, crying so dismally over her own insensibility that the kind\\nold gentleman, though sorely disappointed, did not utter a reproach.\\nHe found it difficult to understand how any girl could help loving\\nLaurie, and hoped she would change her mind, but he knew even better\\nthan Jo that love cannot be forced, so he shook his head sadly and\\nresolved to carry his boy out of harm\\'s way, for Young Impetuosity\\'s\\nparting words to Jo disturbed him more than he would confess.\\n\\nWhen Laurie came home, dead tired but quite composed, his grandfather\\nmet him as if he knew nothing, and kept up the delusion very\\nsuccessfully for an hour or two.  But when they sat together in the\\ntwilight, the time they used to enjoy so much, it was hard work for the\\nold man to ramble on as usual, and harder still for the young one to\\nlisten to praises of the last year\\'s success, which to him now seemed\\nlike love\\'s labor lost.  He bore it as long as he could, then went to\\nhis piano and began to play.  The windows were open, and Jo, walking\\nin the garden with Beth, for once understood music better than her\\nsister, for he played the \\'_Sonata Pathetique_\\', and played it as he\\nnever did before.\\n\\n\"That\\'s very fine, I dare say, but it\\'s sad enough to make one cry.\\nGive us something gayer, lad,\" said Mr. Laurence, whose kind old heart\\nwas full of sympathy, which he longed to show but knew not how.\\n\\nLaurie dashed into a livelier strain, played stormily for several\\nminutes, and would have got through bravely, if in a momentary lull\\nMrs. March\\'s voice had not been heard calling, \"Jo, dear, come in.  I\\nwant you.\"\\n\\nJust what Laurie longed to say, with a different meaning! As he\\nlistened, he lost his place, the music ended with a broken chord, and\\nthe musician sat silent in the dark.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t stand this,\" muttered the old gentleman.  Up he got, groped\\nhis way to the piano, laid a kind hand on either of the broad\\nshoulders, and said, as gently as a woman, \"I know, my boy, I know.\"\\n\\nNo answer for an instant, then Laurie asked sharply, \"Who told you?\"\\n\\n\"Jo herself.\"\\n\\n\"Then there\\'s an end of it!\"  And he shook off his grandfather\\'s hands\\nwith an impatient motion, for though grateful for the sympathy, his\\nman\\'s pride could not bear a man\\'s pity.\\n\\n\"Not quite.  I want to say one thing, and then there shall be an end of\\nit,\" returned Mr. Laurence with unusual mildness. \"You won\\'t care to\\nstay at home now, perhaps?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t intend to run away from a girl.  Jo can\\'t prevent my seeing\\nher, and I shall stay and do it as long as I like,\" interrupted Laurie\\nin a defiant tone.\\n\\n\"Not if you are the gentleman I think you.  I\\'m disappointed, but the\\ngirl can\\'t help it, and the only thing left for you to do is to go away\\nfor a time.  Where will you go?\"\\n\\n\"Anywhere.  I don\\'t care what becomes of me,\" and Laurie got up with a\\nreckless laugh that grated on his grandfather\\'s ear.\\n\\n\"Take it like a man, and don\\'t do anything rash, for God\\'s sake.  Why\\nnot go abroad, as you planned, and forget it?\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"But you\\'ve been wild to go, and I promised you should when you got\\nthrough college.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, but I didn\\'t mean to go alone!\" and Laurie walked fast through the\\nroom with an expression which it was well his grandfather did not see.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t ask you to go alone.  There\\'s someone ready and glad to go\\nwith you, anywhere in the world.\"\\n\\n\"Who, Sir?\" stopping to listen.\\n\\n\"Myself.\"\\n\\nLaurie came back as quickly as he went, and put out his hand, saying\\nhuskily, \"I\\'m a selfish brute, but--you know--Grandfather--\"\\n\\n\"Lord help me, yes, I do know, for I\\'ve been through it all before,\\nonce in my own young days, and then with your father. Now, my dear boy,\\njust sit quietly down and hear my plan.  It\\'s all settled, and can be\\ncarried out at once,\" said Mr. Laurence, keeping hold of the young man,\\nas if fearful that he would break away as his father had done before\\nhim.\\n\\n\"Well, sir, what is it?\" and Laurie sat down, without a sign of\\ninterest in face or voice.\\n\\n\"There is business in London that needs looking after.  I meant you\\nshould attend to it, but I can do it better myself, and things here\\nwill get on very well with Brooke to manage them.  My partners do\\nalmost everything, I\\'m merely holding on until you take my place, and\\ncan be off at any time.\"\\n\\n\"But you hate traveling, Sir.  I can\\'t ask it of you at your age,\"\\nbegan Laurie, who was grateful for the sacrifice, but much preferred to\\ngo alone, if he went at all.\\n\\nThe old gentleman knew that perfectly well, and particularly desired to\\nprevent it, for the mood in which he found his grandson assured him\\nthat it would not be wise to leave him to his own devices.  So,\\nstifling a natural regret at the thought of the home comforts he would\\nleave behind him, he said stoutly, \"Bless your soul, I\\'m not\\nsuperannuated yet.  I quite enjoy the idea.  It will do me good, and my\\nold bones won\\'t suffer, for traveling nowadays is almost as easy as\\nsitting in a chair.\"\\n\\nA restless movement from Laurie suggested that his chair was not easy,\\nor that he did not like the plan, and made the old man add hastily, \"I\\ndon\\'t mean to be a marplot or a burden. I go because I think you\\'d feel\\nhappier than if I was left behind.  I don\\'t intend to gad about with\\nyou, but leave you free to go where you like, while I amuse myself in\\nmy own way.  I\\'ve friends in London and Paris, and should like to visit\\nthem.  Meantime you can go to Italy, Germany, Switzerland, where you\\nwill, and enjoy pictures, music, scenery, and adventures to your\\nheart\\'s content.\"\\n\\nNow, Laurie felt just then that his heart was entirely broken and the\\nworld a howling wilderness, but at the sound of certain words which the\\nold gentleman artfully introduced into his closing sentence, the broken\\nheart gave an unexpected leap, and a green oasis or two suddenly\\nappeared in the howling wilderness.  He sighed, and then said, in a\\nspiritless tone, \"Just as you like, Sir.  It doesn\\'t matter where I go\\nor what I do.\"\\n\\n\"It does to me, remember that, my lad.  I give you entire liberty, but\\nI trust you to make an honest use of it.  Promise me that, Laurie.\"\\n\\n\"Anything you like, Sir.\"\\n\\n\"Good,\" thought the old gentleman.  \"You don\\'t care now, but there\\'ll\\ncome a time when that promise will keep you out of mischief, or I\\'m\\nmuch mistaken.\"\\n\\nBeing an energetic individual, Mr. Laurence struck while the iron was\\nhot, and before the blighted being recovered spirit enough to rebel,\\nthey were off.  During the time necessary for preparation, Laurie bore\\nhimself as young gentleman usually do in such cases.  He was moody,\\nirritable, and pensive by turns, lost his appetite, neglected his dress\\nand devoted much time to playing tempestuously on his piano, avoided\\nJo, but consoled himself by staring at her from his window, with a\\ntragic face that haunted her dreams by night and oppressed her with a\\nheavy sense of guilt by day.  Unlike some sufferers, he never spoke of\\nhis unrequited passion, and would allow no one, not even Mrs. March, to\\nattempt consolation or offer sympathy.  On some accounts, this was a\\nrelief to his friends, but the weeks before his departure were very\\nuncomfortable, and everyone rejoiced that the \\'poor, dear fellow was\\ngoing away to forget his trouble, and come home happy\\'.  Of course, he\\nsmiled darkly at their delusion, but passed it by with the sad\\nsuperiority of one who knew that his fidelity like his love was\\nunalterable.\\n\\nWhen the parting came he affected high spirits, to conceal certain\\ninconvenient emotions which seemed inclined to assert themselves.  This\\ngaiety did not impose upon anybody, but they tried to look as if it did\\nfor his sake, and he got on very well till Mrs. March kissed him, with\\na whisper full of motherly solicitude.  Then feeling that he was going\\nvery fast, he hastily embraced them all round, not forgetting the\\nafflicted Hannah, and ran downstairs as if for his life.  Jo followed a\\nminute after to wave her hand to him if he looked round.  He did look\\nround, came back, put his arms about her as she stood on the step above\\nhim, and looked up at her with a face that made his short appeal\\neloquent and pathetic.\\n\\n\"Oh, Jo, can\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Teddy, dear, I wish I could!\"\\n\\nThat was all, except a little pause.  Then Laurie straightened himself\\nup, said, \"It\\'s all right, never mind,\" and went away without another\\nword.  Ah, but it wasn\\'t all right, and Jo did mind, for while the\\ncurly head lay on her arm a minute after her hard answer, she felt as\\nif she had stabbed her dearest friend, and when he left her without a\\nlook behind him, she knew that the boy Laurie never would come again.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'THIRTY-SIX\\n\\nBETH\\'S SECRET\\n\\nWhen Jo came home that spring, she had been struck with the change in\\nBeth.  No one spoke of it or seemed aware of it, for it had come too\\ngradually to startle those who saw her daily, but to eyes sharpened by\\nabsence, it was very plain and a heavy weight fell on Jo\\'s heart as she\\nsaw her sister\\'s face. It was no paler and but littler thinner than in\\nthe autumn, yet there was a strange, transparent look about it, as if\\nthe mortal was being slowly refined away, and the immortal shining\\nthrough the frail flesh with an indescribably pathetic beauty.  Jo saw\\nand felt it, but said nothing at the time, and soon the first\\nimpression lost much of its power, for Beth seemed happy, no one\\nappeared to doubt that she was better, and presently in other cares Jo\\nfor a time forgot her fear.\\n\\nBut when Laurie was gone, and peace prevailed again, the vague anxiety\\nreturned and haunted her.  She had confessed her sins and been\\nforgiven, but when she showed her savings and proposed a mountain trip,\\nBeth had thanked her heartily, but begged not to go so far away from\\nhome.  Another little visit to the seashore would suit her better, and\\nas Grandma could not be prevailed upon to leave the babies, Jo took\\nBeth down to the quiet place, where she could live much in the open\\nair, and let the fresh sea breezes blow a little color into her pale\\ncheeks.\\n\\nIt was not a fashionable place, but even among the pleasant people\\nthere, the girls made few friends, preferring to live for one another.\\nBeth was too shy to enjoy society, and Jo too wrapped up in her to care\\nfor anyone else.  So they were all in all to each other, and came and\\nwent, quite unconscious of the interest they excited in those about\\nthem, who watched with sympathetic eyes the strong sister and the\\nfeeble one, always together, as if they felt instinctively that a long\\nseparation was not far away.\\n\\nThey did feel it, yet neither spoke of it, for often between ourselves\\nand those nearest and dearest to us there exists a reserve which it is\\nvery hard to overcome.  Jo felt as if a veil had fallen between her\\nheart and Beth\\'s, but when she put out her hand to lift it up, there\\nseemed something sacred in the silence, and she waited for Beth to\\nspeak.  She wondered, and was thankful also, that her parents did not\\nseem to see what she saw, and during the quiet weeks when the shadows\\ngrew so plain to her, she said nothing of it to those at home,\\nbelieving that it would tell itself when Beth came back no better. She\\nwondered still more if her sister really guessed the hard truth, and\\nwhat thoughts were passing through her mind during the long hours when\\nshe lay on the warm rocks with her head in Jo\\'s lap, while the winds\\nblew healthfully over her and the sea made music at her feet.\\n\\nOne day Beth told her.  Jo thought she was asleep, she lay so still,\\nand putting down her book, sat looking at her with wistful eyes, trying\\nto see signs of hope in the faint color on Beth\\'s cheeks.  But she\\ncould not find enough to satisfy her, for the cheeks were very thin,\\nand the hands seemed too feeble to hold even the rosy little shells\\nthey had been collecting. It came to her then more bitterly than ever\\nthat Beth was slowly drifting away from her, and her arms instinctively\\ntightened their hold upon the dearest treasure she possessed. For a\\nminute her eyes were too dim for seeing, and when they cleared, Beth\\nwas looking up at her so tenderly that there was hardly any need for\\nher to say, \"Jo, dear, I\\'m glad you know it.  I\\'ve tried to tell you,\\nbut I couldn\\'t.\"\\n\\nThere was no answer except her sister\\'s cheek against her own, not even\\ntears, for when most deeply moved, Jo did not cry.  She was the weaker\\nthen, and Beth tried to comfort and sustain her, with her arms about\\nher and the soothing words she whispered in her ear.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve known it for a good while, dear, and now I\\'m used to it, it isn\\'t\\nhard to think of or to bear.  Try to see it so and don\\'t be troubled\\nabout me, because it\\'s best, indeed it is.\"\\n\\n\"Is this what made you so unhappy in the autumn, Beth? You did not feel\\nit then, and keep it to yourself so long, did you?\" asked Jo, refusing\\nto see or say that it was best, but glad to know that Laurie had no\\npart in Beth\\'s trouble.\\n\\n\"Yes, I gave up hoping then, but I didn\\'t like to own it. I tried to\\nthink it was a sick fancy, and would not let it trouble anyone.  But\\nwhen I saw you all so well and strong and full of happy plans, it was\\nhard to feel that I could never be like you, and then I was miserable,\\nJo.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Beth, and you didn\\'t tell me, didn\\'t let me comfort and help you?\\nHow could you shut me out, bear it all alone?\"\\n\\nJo\\'s voice was full of tender reproach, and her heart ached to think of\\nthe solitary struggle that must have gone on while Beth learned to say\\ngoodbye to health, love, and life, and take up her cross so cheerfully.\\n\\n\"Perhaps it was wrong, but I tried to do right.  I wasn\\'t sure, no one\\nsaid anything, and I hoped I was mistaken.  It would have been selfish\\nto frighten you all when Marmee was so anxious about Meg, and Amy away,\\nand you so happy with Laurie--at least I thought so then.\"\\n\\n\"And I thought you loved him, Beth, and I went away because I\\ncouldn\\'t,\" cried Jo, glad to say all the truth.\\n\\nBeth looked so amazed at the idea that Jo smiled in spite of her pain,\\nand added softly, \"Then you didn\\'t, dearie? I was afraid it was so, and\\nimagined your poor little heart full of lovelornity all that while.\"\\n\\n\"Why, Jo, how could I, when he was so fond of you?\" asked Beth, as\\ninnocently as a child.  \"I do love him dearly.  He is so good to me,\\nhow can I help It?  But he could never be anything to me but my\\nbrother.  I hope he truly will be, sometime.\"\\n\\n\"Not through me,\" said Jo decidedly.  \"Amy is left for him, and they\\nwould suit excellently, but I have no heart for such things, now.  I\\ndon\\'t care what becomes of anybody but you, Beth. You must get well.\"\\n\\n\"I want to, oh, so much!  I try, but every day I lose a little, and\\nfeel more sure that I shall never gain it back.  It\\'s like the tide,\\nJo, when it turns, it goes slowly, but it can\\'t be stopped.\"\\n\\n\"It shall be stopped, your tide must not turn so soon, nineteen is too\\nyoung, Beth.  I can\\'t let you go.  I\\'ll work and pray and fight against\\nit.  I\\'ll keep you in spite of everything.  There must be ways, it\\ncan\\'t be too late.  God won\\'t be so cruel as to take you from me,\"\\ncried poor Jo rebelliously, for her spirit was far less piously\\nsubmissive than Beth\\'s.\\n\\nSimple, sincere people seldom speak much of their piety.  It shows\\nitself in acts rather than in words, and has more influence than\\nhomilies or protestations.  Beth could not reason upon or explain the\\nfaith that gave her courage and patience to give up life, and\\ncheerfully wait for death.  Like a confiding child, she asked no\\nquestions, but left everything to God and nature, Father and Mother of\\nus all, feeling sure that they, and they only, could teach and\\nstrengthen heart and spirit for this life and the life to come.  She\\ndid not rebuke Jo with saintly speeches, only loved her better for her\\npassionate affection, and clung more closely to the dear human love,\\nfrom which our Father never means us to be weaned, but through which He\\ndraws us closer to Himself.  She could not say, \"I\\'m glad to go,\" for\\nlife was very sweet for her.  She could only sob out, \"I try to be\\nwilling,\" while she held fast to Jo, as the first bitter wave of this\\ngreat sorrow broke over them together.\\n\\nBy and by Beth said, with recovered serenity, \"You\\'ll tell them this\\nwhen we go home?\"\\n\\n\"I think they will see it without words,\" sighed Jo, for now it seemed\\nto her that Beth changed every day.\\n\\n\"Perhaps not.  I\\'ve heard that the people who love best are often\\nblindest to such things.  If they don\\'t see it, you will tell them for\\nme.  I don\\'t want any secrets, and it\\'s kinder to prepare them.  Meg\\nhas John and the babies to comfort her, but you must stand by Father\\nand Mother, won\\'t you Jo?\"\\n\\n\"If I can.  But, Beth, I don\\'t give up yet.  I\\'m going to believe that\\nit is a sick fancy, and not let you think it\\'s true.\" said Jo, trying\\nto speak cheerfully.\\n\\nBeth lay a minute thinking, and then said in her quiet way, \"I don\\'t\\nknow how to express myself, and shouldn\\'t try to anyone but you,\\nbecause I can\\'t speak out except to my Jo.  I only mean to say that I\\nhave a feeling that it never was intended I should live long.  I\\'m not\\nlike the rest of you.  I never made any plans about what I\\'d do when I\\ngrew up.  I never thought of being married, as you all did.  I couldn\\'t\\nseem to imagine myself anything but stupid little Beth, trotting about\\nat home, of no use anywhere but there.  I never wanted to go away, and\\nthe hard part now is the leaving you all.  I\\'m not afraid, but it seems\\nas if I should be homesick for you even in heaven.\"\\n\\nJo could not speak, and for several minutes there was no sound but the\\nsigh of the wind and the lapping of the tide.  A white-winged gull flew\\nby, with the flash of sunshine on its silvery breast.  Beth watched it\\ntill it vanished, and her eyes were full of sadness.  A little\\ngray-coated sand bird came tripping over the beach \\'peeping\\' softly to\\nitself, as if enjoying the sun and sea.  It came quite close to Beth,\\nand looked at her with a friendly eye and sat upon a warm stone,\\ndressing its wet feathers, quite at home.  Beth smiled and felt\\ncomforted, for the tiny thing seemed to offer its small friendship and\\nremind her that a pleasant world was still to be enjoyed.\\n\\n\"Dear little bird!  See, Jo, how tame it is.  I like peeps better than\\nthe gulls.  They are not so wild and handsome, but they seem happy,\\nconfiding little things.  I used to call them my birds last summer, and\\nMother said they reminded her of me--busy, quaker-colored creatures,\\nalways near the shore, and always chirping that contented little song\\nof theirs.  You are the gull, Jo, strong and wild, fond of the storm\\nand the wind, flying far out to sea, and happy all alone.  Meg is the\\nturtledove, and Amy is like the lark she writes about, trying to get up\\namong the clouds, but always dropping down into its nest again.  Dear\\nlittle girl!  She\\'s so ambitious, but her heart is good and tender, and\\nno matter how high she flies, she never will forget home.  I hope I\\nshall see her again, but she seems so far away.\"\\n\\n\"She is coming in the spring, and I mean that you shall be all ready to\\nsee and enjoy her.  I\\'m going to have you well and rosy by that time,\"\\nbegan Jo, feeling that of all the changes in Beth, the talking change\\nwas the greatest, for it seemed to cost no effort now, and she thought\\naloud in a way quite unlike bashful Beth.\\n\\n\"Jo, dear, don\\'t hope any more.  It won\\'t do any good.  I\\'m sure of\\nthat.  We won\\'t be miserable, but enjoy being together while we wait.\\nWe\\'ll have happy times, for I don\\'t suffer much, and I think the tide\\nwill go out easily, if you help me.\"\\n\\nJo leaned down to kiss the tranquil face, and with that silent kiss,\\nshe dedicated herself soul and body to Beth.\\n\\nShe was right.  There was no need of any words when they got home, for\\nFather and Mother saw plainly now what they had prayed to be saved from\\nseeing.  Tired with her short journey, Beth went at once to bed, saying\\nhow glad she was to be home, and when Jo went down, she found that she\\nwould be spared the hard task of telling Beth\\'s secret.  Her father\\nstood leaning his head on the mantelpiece and did not turn as she came\\nin, but her mother stretched out her arms as if for help, and Jo went\\nto comfort her without a word.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'THIRTY-SEVEN\\n\\nNEW IMPRESSIONS\\n\\nAt three o\\'clock in the afternoon, all the fashionable world at Nice\\nmay be seen on the Promenade des Anglais--a charming place, for the\\nwide walk, bordered with palms, flowers, and tropical shrubs, is\\nbounded on one side by the sea, on the other by the grand drive, lined\\nwith hotels and villas, while beyond lie orange orchards and the hills.\\nMany nations are represented, many languages spoken, many costumes\\nworn, and on a sunny day the spectacle is as gay and brilliant as a\\ncarnival.  Haughty English, lively French, sober Germans, handsome\\nSpaniards, ugly Russians, meek Jews, free-and-easy Americans, all\\ndrive, sit, or saunter here, chatting over the news, and criticizing\\nthe latest celebrity who has arrived--Ristori or Dickens, Victor\\nEmmanuel or the Queen of the Sandwich Islands.  The equipages are as\\nvaried as the company and attract as much attention, especially the low\\nbasket barouches in which ladies drive themselves, with a pair of\\ndashing ponies, gay nets to keep their voluminous flounces from\\noverflowing the diminutive vehicles, and little grooms on the perch\\nbehind.\\n\\nAlong this walk, on Christmas Day, a tall young man walked slowly, with\\nhis hands behind him, and a somewhat absent expression of countenance.\\nHe looked like an Italian, was dressed like an Englishman, and had the\\nindependent air of an American--a combination which caused sundry pairs\\nof feminine eyes to look approvingly after him, and sundry dandies in\\nblack velvet suits, with rose-colored neckties, buff gloves, and orange\\nflowers in their buttonholes, to shrug their shoulders, and then envy\\nhim his inches. There were plenty of pretty faces to admire, but the\\nyoung man took little notice of them, except to glance now and then at\\nsome blonde girl in blue.  Presently he strolled out of the promenade\\nand stood a moment at the crossing, as if undecided whether to go and\\nlisten to the band in the Jardin Publique, or to wander along the beach\\ntoward Castle Hill.  The quick trot of ponies\\' feet made him look up,\\nas one of the little carriages, containing a single young lady, came\\nrapidly down the street.  The lady was young, blonde, and dressed in\\nblue.  He stared a minute, then his whole face woke up, and, waving his\\nhat like a boy, he hurried forward to meet her.\\n\\n\"Oh, Laurie, is it really you?  I thought you\\'d never come!\" cried Amy,\\ndropping the reins and holding out both hands, to the great\\nscandalization of a French mamma, who hastened her daughter\\'s steps,\\nlest she should be demoralized by beholding the free manners of these\\n\\'mad English\\'.\\n\\n\"I was detained by the way, but I promised to spend Christmas with you,\\nand here I am.\"\\n\\n\"How is your grandfather?  When did you come?  Where are you staying?\"\\n\\n\"Very well--last night--at the Chauvain.  I called at your hotel, but\\nyou were out.\"\\n\\n\"I have so much to say, I don\\'t know where to begin!  Get in and we can\\ntalk at our ease.  I was going for a drive and longing for company.\\nFlo\\'s saving up for tonight.\"\\n\\n\"What happens then, a ball?\"\\n\\n\"A Christmas party at our hotel.  There are many Americans there, and\\nthey give it in honor of the day.  You\\'ll go with us, of course?  Aunt\\nwill be charmed.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you.  Where now?\" asked Laurie, leaning back and folding his\\narms, a proceeding which suited Amy, who preferred to drive, for her\\nparasol whip and blue reins over the white ponies\\' backs afforded her\\ninfinite satisfaction.\\n\\n\"I\\'m going to the bankers first for letters, and then to Castle Hill.\\nThe view is so lovely, and I like to feed the peacocks. Have you ever\\nbeen there?\"\\n\\n\"Often, years ago, but I don\\'t mind having a look at it.\"\\n\\n\"Now tell me all about yourself.  The last I heard of you, your\\ngrandfather wrote that he expected you from Berlin.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I spent a month there and then joined him in Paris, where he has\\nsettled for the winter.  He has friends there and finds plenty to amuse\\nhim, so I go and come, and we get on capitally.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s a sociable arrangement,\" said Amy, missing something in\\nLaurie\\'s manner, though she couldn\\'t tell what.\\n\\n\"Why, you see, he hates to travel, and I hate to keep still, so we each\\nsuit ourselves, and there is no trouble.  I am often with him, and he\\nenjoys my adventures, while I like to feel that someone is glad to see\\nme when I get back from my wanderings.  Dirty old hole, isn\\'t it?\" he\\nadded, with a look of disgust as they drove along the boulevard to the\\nPlace Napoleon in the old city.\\n\\n\"The dirt is picturesque, so I don\\'t mind.  The river and the hills are\\ndelicious, and these glimpses of the narrow cross streets are my\\ndelight.  Now we shall have to wait for that procession to pass.  It\\'s\\ngoing to the Church of St.  John.\"\\n\\nWhile Laurie listlessly watched the procession of priests under their\\ncanopies, white-veiled nuns bearing lighted tapers, and some\\nbrotherhood in blue chanting as they walked, Amy watched him, and felt\\na new sort of shyness steal over her, for he was changed, and she could\\nnot find the merry-faced boy she left in the moody-looking man beside\\nher.  He was handsomer than ever and greatly improved, she thought, but\\nnow that the flush of pleasure at meeting her was over, he looked tired\\nand spiritless--not sick, nor exactly unhappy, but older and graver\\nthan a year or two of prosperous life should have made him.  She\\ncouldn\\'t understand it and did not venture to ask questions, so she\\nshook her head and touched up her ponies, as the procession wound away\\nacross the arches of the Paglioni bridge and vanished in the church.\\n\\n\"Que pensez-vous?\" she said, airing her French, which had improved in\\nquantity, if not in quality, since she came abroad.\\n\\n\"That mademoiselle has made good use of her time, and the result is\\ncharming,\" replied Laurie, bowing with his hand on his heart and an\\nadmiring look.\\n\\nShe blushed with pleasure, but somehow the compliment did not satisfy\\nher like the blunt praises he used to give her at home, when he\\npromenaded round her on festival occasions, and told her she was\\n\\'altogether jolly\\', with a hearty smile and an approving pat on the\\nhead.  She didn\\'t like the new tone, for though not blase, it sounded\\nindifferent in spite of the look.\\n\\n\"If that\\'s the way he\\'s going to grow up, I wish he\\'d stay a boy,\" she\\nthought, with a curious sense of disappointment and discomfort, trying\\nmeantime to seem quite easy and gay.\\n\\nAt Avigdor\\'s she found the precious home letters and, giving the reins\\nto Laurie, read them luxuriously as they wound up the shady road\\nbetween green hedges, where tea roses bloomed as freshly as in June.\\n\\n\"Beth is very poorly, Mother says.  I often think I ought to go home,\\nbut they all say \\'stay\\'.  So I do, for I shall never have another\\nchance like this,\" said Amy, looking sober over one page.\\n\\n\"I think you are right, there.  You could do nothing at home, and it is\\na great comfort to them to know that you are well and happy, and\\nenjoying so much, my dear.\"\\n\\nHe drew a little nearer, and looked more like his old self as he said\\nthat, and the fear that sometimes weighed on Amy\\'s heart was lightened,\\nfor the look, the act, the brotherly \\'my dear\\', seemed to assure her\\nthat if any trouble did come, she would not be alone in a strange land.\\nPresently she laughed and showed him a small sketch of Jo in her\\nscribbling suit, with the bow rampantly erect upon her cap, and issuing\\nfrom her mouth the words, \\'Genius burns!\\'.\\n\\nLaurie smiled, took it, put it in his vest pocket \\'to keep it from\\nblowing away\\', and listened with interest to the lively letter Amy read\\nhim.\\n\\n\"This will be a regularly merry Christmas to me, with presents in the\\nmorning, you and letters in the afternoon, and a party at night,\" said\\nAmy, as they alighted among the ruins of the old fort, and a flock of\\nsplendid peacocks came trooping about them, tamely waiting to be fed.\\nWhile Amy stood laughing on the bank above him as she scattered crumbs\\nto the brilliant birds, Laurie looked at her as she had looked at him,\\nwith a natural curiosity to see what changes time and absence had\\nwrought.  He found nothing to perplex or disappoint, much to admire and\\napprove, for overlooking a few little affectations of speech and\\nmanner, she was as sprightly and graceful as ever, with the addition of\\nthat indescribable something in dress and bearing which we call\\nelegance.  Always mature for her age, she had gained a certain aplomb\\nin both carriage and conversation, which made her seem more of a woman\\nof the world than she was, but her old petulance now and then showed\\nitself, her strong will still held its own, and her native frankness\\nwas unspoiled by foreign polish.\\n\\nLaurie did not read all this while he watched her feed the peacocks,\\nbut he saw enough to satisfy and interest him, and carried away a\\npretty little picture of a bright-faced girl standing in the sunshine,\\nwhich brought out the soft hue of her dress, the fresh color of her\\ncheeks, the golden gloss of her hair, and made her a prominent figure\\nin the pleasant scene.\\n\\nAs they came up onto the stone plateau that crowns the hill, Amy waved\\nher hand as if welcoming him to her favorite haunt, and said, pointing\\nhere and there, \"Do you remember the Cathedral and the Corso, the\\nfishermen dragging their nets in the bay, and the lovely road to Villa\\nFranca, Schubert\\'s Tower, just below, and best of all, that speck far\\nout to sea which they say is Corsica?\"\\n\\n\"I remember.  It\\'s not much changed,\" he answered without enthusiasm.\\n\\n\"What Jo would give for a sight of that famous speck!\" said Amy,\\nfeeling in good spirits and anxious to see him so also.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" was all he said, but he turned and strained his eyes to see the\\nisland which a greater usurper than even Napoleon now made interesting\\nin his sight.\\n\\n\"Take a good look at it for her sake, and then come and tell me what\\nyou have been doing with yourself all this while,\" said Amy, seating\\nherself, ready for a good talk.\\n\\nBut she did not get it, for though he joined her and answered all her\\nquestions freely, she could only learn that he had roved about the\\nContinent and been to Greece.  So after idling away an hour, they drove\\nhome again, and having paid his respects to Mrs. Carrol, Laurie left\\nthem, promising to return in the evening.\\n\\nIt must be recorded of Amy that she deliberately prinked that night.\\nTime and absence had done its work on both the young people. She had\\nseen her old friend in a new light, not as \\'our boy\\', but as a handsome\\nand agreeable man, and she was conscious of a very natural desire to\\nfind favor in his sight.  Amy knew her good points, and made the most\\nof them with the taste and skill which is a fortune to a poor and\\npretty woman.\\n\\nTarlatan and tulle were cheap at Nice, so she enveloped herself in them\\non such occasions, and following the sensible English fashion of simple\\ndress for young girls, got up charming little toilettes with fresh\\nflowers, a few trinkets, and all manner of dainty devices, which were\\nboth inexpensive and effective.  It must be confessed that the artist\\nsometimes got possession of the woman, and indulged in antique\\ncoiffures, statuesque attitudes, and classic draperies. But, dear\\nheart, we all have our little weaknesses, and find it easy to pardon\\nsuch in the young, who satisfy our eyes with their comeliness, and keep\\nour hearts merry with their artless vanities.\\n\\n\"I do want him to think I look well, and tell them so at home,\" said\\nAmy to herself, as she put on Flo\\'s old white silk ball dress, and\\ncovered it with a cloud of fresh illusion, out of which her white\\nshoulders and golden head emerged with a most artistic effect. Her hair\\nshe had the sense to let alone, after gathering up the thick waves and\\ncurls into a Hebe-like knot at the back of her head.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not the fashion, but it\\'s becoming, and I can\\'t afford to make a\\nfright of myself,\" she used to say, when advised to frizzle, puff, or\\nbraid, as the latest style commanded.\\n\\nHaving no ornaments fine enough for this important occasion, Amy looped\\nher fleecy skirts with rosy clusters of azalea, and framed the white\\nshoulders in delicate green vines.  Remembering the painted boots, she\\nsurveyed her white satin slippers with girlish satisfaction, and\\nchasseed down the room, admiring her aristocratic feet all by herself.\\n\\n\"My new fan just matches my flowers, my gloves fit to a charm, and the\\nreal lace on Aunt\\'s mouchoir gives an air to my whole dress. If I only\\nhad a classical nose and mouth I should be perfectly happy,\" she said,\\nsurveying herself with a critical eye and a candle in each hand.\\n\\nIn spite of this affliction, she looked unusually gay and graceful as\\nshe glided away.  She seldom ran--it did not suit her style, she\\nthought, for being tall, the stately and Junoesque was more appropriate\\nthan the sportive or piquante.  She walked up and down the long saloon\\nwhile waiting for Laurie, and once arranged herself under the\\nchandelier, which had a good effect upon her hair, then she thought\\nbetter of it, and went away to the other end of the room, as if ashamed\\nof the girlish desire to have the first view a propitious one.  It so\\nhappened that she could not have done a better thing, for Laurie came\\nin so quietly she did not hear him, and as she stood at the distant\\nwindow, with her head half turned and one hand gathering up her dress,\\nthe slender, white figure against the red curtains was as effective as\\na well-placed statue.\\n\\n\"Good evening, Diana!\" said Laurie, with the look of satisfaction she\\nliked to see in his eyes when they rested on her.\\n\\n\"Good evening, Apollo!\" she answered, smiling back at him, for he too\\nlooked unusually debonair, and the thought of entering the ballroom on\\nthe arm of such a personable man caused Amy to pity the four plain\\nMisses Davis from the bottom of her heart.\\n\\n\"Here are your flowers.  I arranged them myself, remembering that you\\ndidn\\'t like what Hannah calls a \\'sot-bookay\\',\" said Laurie, handing her\\na delicate nosegay, in a holder that she had long coveted as she daily\\npassed it in Cardiglia\\'s window.\\n\\n\"How kind you are!\" she exclaimed gratefully.  \"If I\\'d known you were\\ncoming I\\'d have had something ready for you today, though not as pretty\\nas this, I\\'m afraid.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you.  It isn\\'t what it should be, but you have improved it,\" he\\nadded, as she snapped the silver bracelet on her wrist.\\n\\n\"Please don\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"I thought you liked that sort of thing.\"\\n\\n\"Not from you, it doesn\\'t sound natural, and I like your old bluntness\\nbetter.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad of it,\" he answered, with a look of relief, then buttoned her\\ngloves for her, and asked if his tie was straight, just as he used to\\ndo when they went to parties together at home.\\n\\nThe company assembled in the long salle a manger, that evening, was\\nsuch as one sees nowhere but on the Continent.  The hospitable\\nAmericans had invited every acquaintance they had in Nice, and having\\nno prejudice against titles, secured a few to add luster to their\\nChristmas ball.\\n\\nA Russian prince condescended to sit in a corner for an hour and talk\\nwith a massive lady, dressed like Hamlet\\'s mother in black velvet with\\na pearl bridle under her chin.  A Polish count, aged eighteen, devoted\\nhimself to the ladies, who pronounced him, \\'a fascinating dear\\', and a\\nGerman Serene Something, having come to supper alone, roamed vaguely\\nabout, seeking what he might devour.  Baron Rothschild\\'s private\\nsecretary, a large-nosed Jew in tight boots, affably beamed upon the\\nworld, as if his master\\'s name crowned him with a golden halo.  A stout\\nFrenchman, who knew the Emperor, came to indulge his mania for dancing,\\nand Lady de Jones, a British matron, adorned the scene with her little\\nfamily of eight.  Of course, there were many light-footed,\\nshrill-voiced American girls, handsome, lifeless-looking English ditto,\\nand a few plain but piquante French demoiselles, likewise the usual set\\nof traveling young gentlemen who disported themselves gaily, while\\nmammas of all nations lined the walls and smiled upon them benignly\\nwhen they danced with their daughters.\\n\\nAny young girl can imagine Amy\\'s state of mind when she \\'took the\\nstage\\' that night, leaning on Laurie\\'s arm.  She knew she looked well,\\nshe loved to dance, she felt that her foot was on her native heath in a\\nballroom, and enjoyed the delightful sense of power which comes when\\nyoung girls first discover the new and lovely kingdom they are born to\\nrule by virtue of beauty, youth, and womanhood.  She did pity the Davis\\ngirls, who were awkward, plain, and destitute of escort, except a grim\\npapa and three grimmer maiden aunts, and she bowed to them in her\\nfriendliest manner as she passed, which was good of her, as it\\npermitted them to see her dress, and burn with curiosity to know who\\nher distinguished-looking friend might be.  With the first burst of the\\nband, Amy\\'s color rose, her eyes began to sparkle, and her feet to tap\\nthe floor impatiently, for she danced well and wanted Laurie to know\\nit.  Therefore the shock she received can better be imagined than\\ndescribed, when he said in a perfectly tranquil tone, \"Do you care to\\ndance?\"\\n\\n\"One usually does at a ball.\"\\n\\nHer amazed look and quick answer caused Laurie to repair his error as\\nfast as possible.\\n\\n\"I meant the first dance.  May I have the honor?\"\\n\\n\"I can give you one if I put off the Count.  He dances divinely, but he\\nwill excuse me, as you are an old friend,\" said Amy, hoping that the\\nname would have a good effect, and show Laurie that she was not to be\\ntrifled with.\\n\\n\"Nice little boy, but rather a short Pole to support...\\n\\n    A daughter of the gods,\\n    Devinely tall, and most divinely fair,\"\\n\\nwas all the satisfaction she got, however.\\n\\nThe set in which they found themselves was composed of English, and Amy\\nwas compelled to walk decorously through a cotillion, feeling all the\\nwhile as if she could dance the tarantella with relish.  Laurie\\nresigned her to the \\'nice little boy\\', and went to do his duty to Flo,\\nwithout securing Amy for the joys to come, which reprehensible want of\\nforethought was properly punished, for she immediately engaged herself\\ntill supper, meaning to relent if he then gave any signs penitence. She\\nshowed him her ball book with demure satisfaction when he strolled\\ninstead of rushed up to claim her for the next, a glorious polka\\nredowa.  But his polite regrets didn\\'t impose upon her, and when she\\ngalloped away with the Count, she saw Laurie sit down by her aunt with\\nan actual expression of relief.\\n\\nThat was unpardonable, and Amy took no more notice of him for a long\\nwhile, except a word now and then when she came to her chaperon between\\nthe dances for a necessary pin or a moment\\'s rest.  Her anger had a\\ngood effect, however, for she hid it under a smiling face, and seemed\\nunusually blithe and brilliant.  Laurie\\'s eyes followed her with\\npleasure, for she neither romped nor sauntered, but danced with spirit\\nand grace, making the delightsome pastime what it should be.  He very\\nnaturally fell to studying her from this new point of view, and before\\nthe evening was half over, had decided that \\'little Amy was going to\\nmake a very charming woman\\'.\\n\\nIt was a lively scene, for soon the spirit of the social season took\\npossession of everyone, and Christmas merriment made all faces shine,\\nhearts happy, and heels light.  The musicians fiddled, tooted, and\\nbanged as if they enjoyed it, everybody danced who could, and those who\\ncouldn\\'t admired their neighbors with uncommon warmth.  The air was\\ndark with Davises, and many Joneses gamboled like a flock of young\\ngiraffes.  The golden secretary darted through the room like a meteor\\nwith a dashing French-woman who carpeted the floor with her pink satin\\ntrain.  The serene Teuton found the supper-table and was happy, eating\\nsteadily through the bill of fare, and dismayed the garcons by the\\nravages he committed.  But the Emperor\\'s friend covered himself with\\nglory, for he danced everything, whether he knew it or not, and\\nintroduced impromptu pirouettes when the figures bewildered him.  The\\nboyish abandon of that stout man was charming to behold, for though he\\n\\'carried weight\\', he danced like an India-rubber ball.  He ran, he\\nflew, he pranced, his face glowed, his bald head shown, his coattails\\nwaved wildly, his pumps actually twinkled in the air, and when the\\nmusic stopped, he wiped the drops from his brow, and beamed upon his\\nfellow men like a French Pickwick without glasses.\\n\\nAmy and her Pole distinguished themselves by equal enthusiasm but more\\ngraceful agility, and Laurie found himself involuntarily keeping time\\nto the rhythmic rise and fall of the white slippers as they flew by as\\nindefatigably as if winged. When little Vladimir finally relinquished\\nher, with assurances that he was \\'desolated to leave so early\\', she was\\nready to rest, and see how her recreant knight had borne his punishment.\\n\\nIt had been successful, for at three-and-twenty, blighted affections\\nfind a balm in friendly society, and young nerves will thrill, young\\nblood dance, and healthy young spirits rise, when subjected to the\\nenchantment of beauty, light, music, and motion.  Laurie had a waked-up\\nlook as he rose to give her his seat, and when he hurried away to bring\\nher some supper, she said to herself, with a satisfied smile, \"Ah, I\\nthought that would do him good!\"\\n\\n\"You look like Balzac\\'s \\'_Femme Peinte Par Elle-Meme_\\',\" he said, as he\\nfanned her with one hand and held her coffee cup in the other.\\n\\n\"My rouge won\\'t come off.\" and Amy rubbed her brilliant cheek, and\\nshowed him her white glove with a sober simplicity that made him laugh\\noutright.\\n\\n\"What do you call this stuff?\" he asked, touching a fold of her dress\\nthat had blown over his knee.\\n\\n\"Illusion.\"\\n\\n\"Good name for it.  It\\'s very pretty--new thing, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s as old as the hills.  You have seen it on dozens of girls, and\\nyou never found out that it was pretty till now--stupide!\"\\n\\n\"I never saw it on you before, which accounts for the mistake, you see.\"\\n\\n\"None of that, it is forbidden.  I\\'d rather take coffee than\\ncompliments just now.  No, don\\'t lounge, it makes me nervous.\"\\n\\nLaurie sat bold upright, and meekly took her empty plate feeling an odd\\nsort of pleasure in having \\'little Amy\\' order him about, for she had\\nlost her shyness now, and felt an irrestible desire to trample on him,\\nas girls have a delightful way of doing when lords of creation show any\\nsigns of subjection.\\n\\n\"Where did you learn all this sort of thing?\" he asked with a quizzical\\nlook.\\n\\n\"As \\'this sort of thing\\' is rather a vague expression, would you kindly\\nexplain?\" returned Amy, knowing perfectly well what he meant, but\\nwickedly leaving him to describe what is indescribable.\\n\\n\"Well--the general air, the style, the self-possession,\\nthe--the--illusion--you know\", laughed Laurie, breaking down and\\nhelping himself out of his quandary with the new word.\\n\\nAmy was gratified, but of course didn\\'t show it, and demurely answered,\\n\"Foreign life polishes one in spite of one\\'s self.  I study as well as\\nplay, and as for this\"--with a little gesture toward her dress--\"why,\\ntulle is cheap, posies to be had for nothing, and I am used to making\\nthe most of my poor little things.\"\\n\\nAmy rather regretted that last sentence, fearing it wasn\\'t in good\\ntaste, but Laurie liked her better for it, and found himself both\\nadmiring and respecting the brave patience that made the most of\\nopportunity, and the cheerful spirit that covered poverty with flowers.\\nAmy did not know why he looked at her so kindly, nor why he filled up\\nher book with his own name, and devoted himself to her for the rest of\\nthe evening in the most delightful manner; but the impulse that wrought\\nthis agreeable change was the result of one of the new impressions\\nwhich both of them were unconsciously giving and receiving.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'THIRTY-EIGHT\\n\\nON THE SHELF\\n\\nIn France the young girls have a dull time of it till they are married,\\nwhen \\'Vive la liberte!\\' becomes their motto.  In America, as everyone\\nknows, girls early sign the declaration of independence, and enjoy\\ntheir freedom with republican zest, but the young matrons usually\\nabdicate with the first heir to the throne and go into a seclusion\\nalmost as close as a French nunnery, though by no means as quiet.\\nWhether they like it or not, they are virtually put upon the shelf as\\nsoon as the wedding excitement is over, and most of them might exclaim,\\nas did a very pretty woman the other day, \"I\\'m as handsome as ever, but\\nno one takes any notice of me because I\\'m married.\"\\n\\nNot being a belle or even a fashionable lady, Meg did not experience\\nthis affliction till her babies were a year old, for in her little\\nworld primitive customs prevailed, and she found herself more admired\\nand beloved than ever.\\n\\nAs she was a womanly little woman, the maternal instinct was very\\nstrong, and she was entirely absorbed in her children, to the utter\\nexclusion of everything and everybody else.  Day and night she brooded\\nover them with tireless devotion and anxiety, leaving John to the\\ntender mercies of the help, for an Irish lady now presided over the\\nkitchen department.  Being a domestic man, John decidedly missed the\\nwifely attentions he had been accustomed to receive, but as he adored\\nhis babies, he cheerfully relinquished his comfort for a time,\\nsupposing with masculine ignorance that peace would soon be restored.\\nBut three months passed, and there was no return of repose.  Meg looked\\nworn and nervous, the babies absorbed every minute of her time, the\\nhouse was neglected, and Kitty, the cook, who took life \\'aisy\\', kept\\nhim on short commons.  When he went out in the morning he was\\nbewildered by small commissions for the captive mamma, if he came gaily\\nin at night, eager to embrace his family, he was quenched by a \"Hush!\\nThey are just asleep after worrying all day.\"  If he proposed a little\\namusement at home, \"No, it would disturb the babies.\"  If he hinted at\\na lecture or a concert, he was answered with a reproachful look, and a\\ndecided--\"Leave my children for pleasure, never!\"  His sleep was broken\\nby infant wails and visions of a phantom figure pacing noiselessly to\\nand fro in the watches of the night.  His meals were interrupted by the\\nfrequent flight of the presiding genius, who deserted him, half-helped,\\nif a muffled chirp sounded from the nest above.  And when he read his\\npaper of an evening, Demi\\'s colic got into the shipping list and\\nDaisy\\'s fall affected the price of stocks, for Mrs. Brooke was only\\ninterested in domestic news.\\n\\nThe poor man was very uncomfortable, for the children had bereft him of\\nhis wife, home was merely a nursery and the perpetual \\'hushing\\' made\\nhim feel like a brutal intruder whenever he entered the sacred\\nprecincts of Babyland.  He bore it very patiently for six months, and\\nwhen no signs of amendment appeared, he did what other paternal exiles\\ndo--tried to get a little comfort elsewhere.  Scott had married and\\ngone to housekeeping not far off, and John fell into the way of running\\nover for an hour or two of an evening, when his own parlor was empty,\\nand his own wife singing lullabies that seemed to have no end.  Mrs.\\nScott was a lively, pretty girl, with nothing to do but be agreeable,\\nand she performed her mission most successfully.  The parlor was always\\nbright and attractive, the chessboard ready, the piano in tune, plenty\\nof gay gossip, and a nice little supper set forth in tempting style.\\n\\nJohn would have preferred his own fireside if it had not been so\\nlonely, but as it was he gratefully took the next best thing and\\nenjoyed his neighbor\\'s society.\\n\\nMeg rather approved of the new arrangement at first, and found it a\\nrelief to know that John was having a good time instead of dozing in\\nthe parlor, or tramping about the house and waking the children.  But\\nby-and-by, when the teething worry was over and the idols went to sleep\\nat proper hours, leaving Mamma time to rest, she began to miss John,\\nand find her workbasket dull company, when he was not sitting opposite\\nin his old dressing gown, comfortably scorching his slippers on the\\nfender.  She would not ask him to stay at home, but felt injured\\nbecause he did not know that she wanted him without being told,\\nentirely forgetting the many evenings he had waited for her in vain.\\nShe was nervous and worn out with watching and worry, and in that\\nunreasonable frame of mind which the best of mothers occasionally\\nexperience when domestic cares oppress them.  Want of exercise robs\\nthem of cheerfulness, and too much devotion to that idol of American\\nwomen, the teapot, makes them feel as if they were all nerve and no\\nmuscle.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she would say, looking in the glass, \"I\\'m getting old and ugly.\\nJohn doesn\\'t find me interesting any longer, so he leaves his faded\\nwife and goes to see his pretty neighbor, who has no incumbrances.\\nWell, the babies love me, they don\\'t care if I am thin and pale and\\nhaven\\'t time to crimp my hair, they are my comfort, and some day John\\nwill see what I\\'ve gladly sacrificed for them, won\\'t he, my precious?\"\\n\\nTo which pathetic appeal Daisy would answer with a coo, or Demi with a\\ncrow, and Meg would put by her lamentations for a maternal revel, which\\nsoothed her solitude for the time being. But the pain increased as\\npolitics absorbed John, who was always running over to discuss\\ninteresting points with Scott, quite unconscious that Meg missed him.\\nNot a word did she say, however, till her mother found her in tears one\\nday, and insisted on knowing what the matter was, for Meg\\'s drooping\\nspirits had not escaped her observation.\\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t tell anyone except you, Mother, but I really do need\\nadvice, for if John goes on much longer I might as well be widowed,\"\\nreplied Mrs. Brooke, drying her tears on Daisy\\'s bib with an injured\\nair.\\n\\n\"Goes on how, my dear?\" asked her mother anxiously.\\n\\n\"He\\'s away all day, and at night when I want to see him, he is\\ncontinually going over to the Scotts\\'.  It isn\\'t fair that I should\\nhave the hardest work, and never any amusement. Men are very selfish,\\neven the best of them.\"\\n\\n\"So are women.  Don\\'t blame John till you see where you are wrong\\nyourself.\"\\n\\n\"But it can\\'t be right for him to neglect me.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you neglect him?\"\\n\\n\"Why, Mother, I thought you\\'d take my part!\"\\n\\n\"So I do, as far as sympathizing goes, but I think the fault is yours,\\nMeg.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t see how.\"\\n\\n\"Let me show you.  Did John ever neglect you, as you call it, while you\\nmade it a point to give him your society of an evening, his only\\nleisure time?\"\\n\\n\"No, but I can\\'t do it now, with two babies to tend.\"\\n\\n\"I think you could, dear, and I think you ought.  May I speak quite\\nfreely, and will you remember that it\\'s Mother who blames as well as\\nMother who sympathizes?\"\\n\\n\"Indeed I will!  Speak to me as if I were little Meg again. I often\\nfeel as if I needed teaching more than ever since these babies look to\\nme for everything.\"\\n\\nMeg drew her low chair beside her mother\\'s, and with a little\\ninterruption in either lap, the two women rocked and talked lovingly\\ntogether, feeling that the tie of motherhood made them more one than\\never.\\n\\n\"You have only made the mistake that most young wives make--forgotten\\nyour duty to your husband in your love for your children. A very\\nnatural and forgivable mistake, Meg, but one that had better be\\nremedied before you take to different ways, for children should draw\\nyou nearer than ever, not separate you, as if they were all yours, and\\nJohn had nothing to do but support them.  I\\'ve seen it for some weeks,\\nbut have not spoken, feeling sure it would come right in time.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid it won\\'t.  If I ask him to stay, he\\'ll think I\\'m jealous,\\nand I wouldn\\'t insult him by such an idea.  He doesn\\'t see that I want\\nhim, and I don\\'t know how to tell him without words.\"\\n\\n\"Make it so pleasant he won\\'t want to go away.  My dear, he\\'s longing\\nfor his little home, but it isn\\'t home without you, and you are always\\nin the nursery.\"\\n\\n\"Oughtn\\'t I to be there?\"\\n\\n\"Not all the time, too much confinement makes you nervous, and then you\\nare unfitted for everything.  Besides, you owe something to John as\\nwell as to the babies.  Don\\'t neglect husband for children, don\\'t shut\\nhim out of the nursery, but teach him how to help in it.  His place is\\nthere as well as yours, and the children need him.  Let him feel that\\nhe has a part to do, and he will do it gladly and faithfully, and it\\nwill be better for you all.\"\\n\\n\"You really think so, Mother?\"\\n\\n\"I know it, Meg, for I\\'ve tried it, and I seldom give advice unless\\nI\\'ve proved its practicability.  When you and Jo were little, I went on\\njust as you are, feeling as if I didn\\'t do my duty unless I devoted\\nmyself wholly to you.  Poor Father took to his books, after I had\\nrefused all offers of help, and left me to try my experiment alone.  I\\nstruggled along as well as I could, but Jo was too much for me.  I\\nnearly spoiled her by indulgence.  You were poorly, and I worried about\\nyou till I fell sick myself.  Then Father came to the rescue, quietly\\nmanaged everything, and made himself so helpful that I saw my mistake,\\nand never have been able to get on without him since.  That is the\\nsecret of our home happiness.  He does not let business wean him from\\nthe little cares and duties that affect us all, and I try not to let\\ndomestic worries destroy my interest in his pursuits.  Each do our part\\nalone in many things, but at home we work together, always.\"\\n\\n\"It is so, Mother, and my great wish is to be to my husband and\\nchildren what you have been to yours.  Show me how, I\\'ll do anything\\nyou say.\"\\n\\n\"You always were my docile daughter.  Well, dear, if I were you, I\\'d\\nlet John have more to do with the management of Demi, for the boy needs\\ntraining, and it\\'s none too soon to begin. Then I\\'d do what I have\\noften proposed, let Hannah come and help you.  She is a capital nurse,\\nand you may trust the precious babies to her while you do more\\nhousework.  You need the exercise, Hannah would enjoy the rest, and\\nJohn would find his wife again. Go out more, keep cheerful as well as\\nbusy, for you are the sunshine-maker of the family, and if you get\\ndismal there is no fair weather.  Then I\\'d try to take an interest in\\nwhatever John likes--talk with him, let him read to you, exchange\\nideas, and help each other in that way.  Don\\'t shut yourself up in a\\nbandbox because you are a woman, but understand what is going on, and\\neducate yourself to take your part in the world\\'s work, for it all\\naffects you and yours.\"\\n\\n\"John is so sensible, I\\'m afraid he will think I\\'m stupid if I ask\\nquestions about politics and things.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t believe he would.  Love covers a multitude of sins, and of\\nwhom could you ask more freely than of him?  Try it, and see if he\\ndoesn\\'t find your society far more agreeable than Mrs. Scott\\'s suppers.\"\\n\\n\"I will.  Poor John!  I\\'m afraid I have neglected him sadly, but I\\nthought I was right, and he never said anything.\"\\n\\n\"He tried not to be selfish, but he has felt rather forlorn, I fancy.\\nThis is just the time, Meg, when young married people are apt to grow\\napart, and the very time when they ought to be most together, for the\\nfirst tenderness soon wears off, unless care is taken to preserve it.\\nAnd no time is so beautiful and precious to parents as the first years\\nof the little lives given to them to train.  Don\\'t let John be a\\nstranger to the babies, for they will do more to keep him safe and\\nhappy in this world of trial and temptation than anything else, and\\nthrough them you will learn to know and love one another as you should.\\nNow, dear, good-by.  Think over Mother\\'s preachment, act upon it if it\\nseems good, and God bless you all.\"\\n\\nMeg did think it over, found it good, and acted upon it, though the\\nfirst attempt was not made exactly as she planned to have it.  Of\\ncourse the children tyrannized over her, and ruled the house as soon as\\nthey found out that kicking and squalling brought them whatever they\\nwanted.  Mamma was an abject slave to their caprices, but Papa was not\\nso easily subjugated, and occasionally afflicted his tender spouse by\\nan attempt at paternal discipline with his obstreperous son. For Demi\\ninherited a trifle of his sire\\'s firmness of character, we won\\'t call\\nit obstinacy, and when he made up his little mind to have or to do\\nanything, all the king\\'s horses and all the king\\'s men could not change\\nthat pertinacious little mind.  Mamma thought the dear too young to be\\ntaught to conquer his prejudices, but Papa believed that it never was\\ntoo soon to learn obedience.  So Master Demi early discovered that when\\nhe undertook to \\'wrastle\\' with \\'Parpar\\', he always got the worst of it,\\nyet like the Englishman, baby respected the man who conquered him, and\\nloved the father whose grave \"No, no,\" was more impressive than all\\nMamma\\'s love pats.\\n\\nA few days after the talk with her mother, Meg resolved to try a social\\nevening with John, so she ordered a nice supper, set the parlor in\\norder, dressed herself prettily, and put the children to bed early,\\nthat nothing should interfere with her experiment.  But unfortunately\\nDemi\\'s most unconquerable prejudice was against going to bed, and that\\nnight he decided to go on a rampage.  So poor Meg sang and rocked, told\\nstories and tried every sleep-prevoking wile she could devise, but all\\nin vain, the big eyes wouldn\\'t shut, and long after Daisy had gone to\\nbyelow, like the chubby little bunch of good nature she was, naughty\\nDemi lay staring at the light, with the most discouragingly wide-awake\\nexpression of countenance.\\n\\n\"Will Demi lie still like a good boy, while Mamma runs down and gives\\npoor Papa his tea?\" asked Meg, as the hall door softly closed, and the\\nwell-known step went tip-toeing into the dining room.\\n\\n\"Me has tea!\" said Demi, preparing to join in the revel.\\n\\n\"No, but I\\'ll save you some little cakies for breakfast, if you\\'ll go\\nbye-bye like Daisy.  Will you, lovey?\"\\n\\n\"Iss!\" and Demi shut his eyes tight, as if to catch sleep and hurry the\\ndesired day.\\n\\nTaking advantage of the propitious moment, Meg slipped away and ran\\ndown to greet her husband with a smiling face and the little blue bow\\nin her hair which was his especial admiration.  He saw it at once and\\nsaid with pleased surprise, \"Why, little mother, how gay we are\\ntonight.  Do you expect company?\"\\n\\n\"Only you, dear.\"\\n\\n\"Is it a birthday, anniversary, or anything?\"\\n\\n\"No, I\\'m tired of being dowdy, so I dressed up as a change.  You always\\nmake yourself nice for table, no matter how tired you are, so why\\nshouldn\\'t I when I have the time?\"\\n\\n\"I do it out of respect for you, my dear,\" said old-fashioned John.\\n\\n\"Ditto, ditto, Mr. Brooke,\" laughed Meg, looking young and pretty\\nagain, as she nodded to him over the teapot.\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s altogether delightful, and like old times.  This tastes\\nright.  I drink your health, dear.\" and John sipped his tea with an air\\nof reposeful rapture, which was of very short duration however, for as\\nhe put down his cup, the door handle rattled mysteriously, and a little\\nvoice was heard, saying impatiently...\\n\\n\"Opy doy.  Me\\'s tummin!\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s that naughty boy.  I told him to go to sleep alone, and here he\\nis, downstairs, getting his death a-cold pattering over that canvas,\"\\nsaid Meg, answering the call.\\n\\n\"Mornin\\' now,\" announced Demi in joyful tone as he entered, with his\\nlong nightgown gracefully festooned over his arm and every curl bobbing\\ngayly as he pranced about the table, eyeing the \\'cakies\\' with loving\\nglances.\\n\\n\"No, it isn\\'t morning yet.  You must go to bed, and not trouble poor\\nMamma.  Then you can have the little cake with sugar on it.\"\\n\\n\"Me loves Parpar,\" said the artful one, preparing to climb the paternal\\nknee and revel in forbidden joys.  But John shook his head, and said to\\nMeg...\\n\\n\"If you told him to stay up there, and go to sleep alone, make him do\\nit, or he will never learn to mind you.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, of course.  Come, Demi,\"  and Meg led her son away, feeling a\\nstrong desire to spank the little marplot who hopped beside her,\\nlaboring under the delusion that the bribe was to be administered as\\nsoon as they reached the nursery.\\n\\nNor was he disappointed, for that shortsighted woman actually gave him\\na lump of sugar, tucked him into his bed, and forbade any more\\npromenades till morning.\\n\\n\"Iss!\" said Demi the perjured, blissfully sucking his sugar, and\\nregarding his first attempt as eminently successful.\\n\\nMeg returned to her place, and supper was progressing pleasantly, when\\nthe little ghost walked again, and exposed the maternal delinquencies\\nby boldly demanding, \"More sudar, Marmar.\"\\n\\n\"Now this won\\'t do,\" said John, hardening his heart against the\\nengaging little sinner.  \"We shall never know any peace till that child\\nlearns to go to bed properly.  You have made a slave of yourself long\\nenough.  Give him one lesson, and then there will be an end of it.  Put\\nhim in his bed and leave him, Meg.\"\\n\\n\"He won\\'t stay there, he never does unless I sit by him.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll manage him.  Demi, go upstairs, and get into your bed, as Mamma\\nbids you.\"\\n\\n\"S\\'ant!\" replied the young rebel, helping himself to the coveted\\n\\'cakie\\', and beginning to eat the same with calm audacity.\\n\\n\"You must never say that to Papa.  I shall carry you if you don\\'t go\\nyourself.\"\\n\\n\"Go \\'way, me don\\'t love Parpar.\" and Demi retired to his mother\\'s\\nskirts for protection.\\n\\nBut even that refuge proved unavailing, for he was delivered over to\\nthe enemy, with a \"Be gentle with him, John,\" which struck the culprit\\nwith dismay, for when Mamma deserted him, then the judgment day was at\\nhand.  Bereft of his cake, defrauded of his frolic, and borne away by a\\nstrong hand to that detested bed, poor Demi could not restrain his\\nwrath, but openly defied Papa, and kicked and screamed lustily all the\\nway upstairs.  The minute he was put into bed on one side, he rolled\\nout on the other, and made for the door, only to be ignominiously\\ncaught up by the tail of his little toga and put back again, which\\nlively performance was kept up till the young man\\'s strength gave out,\\nwhen he devoted himself to roaring at the top of his voice.  This vocal\\nexercise usually conquered Meg, but John sat as unmoved as the post\\nwhich is popularly believed to be deaf.  No coaxing, no sugar, no\\nlullaby, no story, even the light was put out and only the red glow of\\nthe fire enlivened the \\'big dark\\' which Demi regarded with curiosity\\nrather than fear.  This new order of things disgusted him, and he\\nhowled dismally for \\'Marmar\\', as his angry passions subsided, and\\nrecollections of his tender bondwoman returned to the captive autocrat.\\nThe plaintive wail which succeeded the passionate roar went to Meg\\'s\\nheart, and she ran up to say beseechingly...\\n\\n\"Let me stay with him, he\\'ll be good now, John.\"\\n\\n\"No, my dear.  I\\'ve told him he must go to sleep, as you bid him, and\\nhe must, if I stay here all night.\"\\n\\n\"But he\\'ll cry himself sick,\" pleaded Meg, reproaching herself for\\ndeserting her boy.\\n\\n\"No, he won\\'t, he\\'s so tired he will soon drop off and then the matter\\nis settled, for he will understand that he has got to mind.  Don\\'t\\ninterfere, I\\'ll manage him.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s my child, and I can\\'t have his spirit broken by harshness.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s my child, and I won\\'t have his temper spoiled by indulgence.  Go\\ndown, my dear, and leave the boy to me.\"\\n\\nWhen John spoke in that masterful tone, Meg always obeyed, and never\\nregretted her docility.\\n\\n\"Please let me kiss him once, John?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly.  Demi, say good night to Mamma, and let her go and rest,\\nfor she is very tired with taking care of you all day.\"\\n\\nMeg always insisted upon it that the kiss won the victory, for after it\\nwas given, Demi sobbed more quietly, and lay quite still at the bottom\\nof the bed, whither he had wriggled in his anguish of mind.\\n\\n\"Poor little man, he\\'s worn out with sleep and crying.  I\\'ll cover him\\nup, and then go and set Meg\\'s heart at rest,\" thought John, creeping to\\nthe bedside, hoping to find his rebellious heir asleep.\\n\\nBut he wasn\\'t, for the moment his father peeped at him, Demi\\'s eyes\\nopened, his little chin began to quiver, and he put up his arms, saying\\nwith a penitent hiccough, \"Me\\'s dood, now.\"\\n\\nSitting on the stairs outside Meg wondered at the long silence which\\nfollowed the uproar, and after imagining all sorts of impossible\\naccidents, she slipped into the room to set her fears at rest.  Demi\\nlay fast asleep, not in his usual spreadeagle attitude, but in a\\nsubdued bunch, cuddled close in the circle of his father\\'s arm and\\nholding his father\\'s finger, as if he felt that justice was tempered\\nwith mercy, and had gone to sleep a sadder and wiser baby.  So held,\\nJohn had waited with a womanly patience till the little hand relaxed\\nits hold, and while waiting had fallen asleep, more tired by that\\ntussle with his son than with his whole day\\'s work.\\n\\nAs Meg stood watching the two faces on the pillow, she smiled to\\nherself, and then slipped away again, saying in a satisfied tone, \"I\\nnever need fear that John will be too harsh with my babies.  He does\\nknow how to manage them, and will be a great help, for Demi is getting\\ntoo much for me.\"\\n\\nWhen John came down at last, expecting to find a pensive or reproachful\\nwife, he was agreeably surprised to find Meg placidly trimming a\\nbonnet, and to be greeted with the request to read something about the\\nelection, if he was not too tired.  John saw in a minute that a\\nrevolution of some kind was going on, but wisely asked no questions,\\nknowing that Meg was such a transparent little person, she couldn\\'t\\nkeep a secret to save her life, and therefore the clue would soon\\nappear.  He read a long debate with the most amiable readiness and then\\nexplained it in his most lucid manner, while Meg tried to look deeply\\ninterested, to ask intelligent questions, and keep her thoughts from\\nwandering from the state of the nation to the state of her bonnet.  In\\nher secret soul, however, she decided that politics were as bad as\\nmathematics, and that the mission of politicians seemed to be calling\\neach other names, but she kept these feminine ideas to herself, and\\nwhen John paused, shook her head and said with what she thought\\ndiplomatic ambiguity, \"Well, I really don\\'t see what we are coming to.\"\\n\\nJohn laughed, and watched her for a minute, as she poised a pretty\\nlittle preparation of lace and flowers on her hand, and regarded it\\nwith the genuine interest which his harangue had failed to waken.\\n\\n\"She is trying to like politics for my sake, so I\\'ll try and like\\nmillinery for hers, that\\'s only fair,\" thought John the Just, adding\\naloud, \"That\\'s very pretty.  Is it what you call a breakfast cap?\"\\n\\n\"My dear man, it\\'s a bonnet!   My very best go-to-concert-and-theater\\nbonnet.\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, it was so small, I naturally mistook it for one of\\nthe flyaway things you sometimes wear. How do you keep it on?\"\\n\\n\"These bits of lace are fastened under the chin with a rosebud, so,\"\\nand Meg illustrated by putting on the bonnet and regarding him with an\\nair of calm satisfaction that was irresistible.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a love of a bonnet, but I prefer the face inside, for it looks\\nyoung and happy again,\" and John kissed the smiling face, to the great\\ndetriment of the rosebud under the chin.\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad you like it, for I want you to take me to one of the new\\nconcerts some night.  I really need some music to put me in tune.  Will\\nyou, please?\"\\n\\n\"Of course I will, with all my heart, or anywhere else you like.  You\\nhave been shut up so long, it will do you no end of good, and I shall\\nenjoy it, of all things.  What put it into your head, little mother?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I had a talk with Marmee the other day, and told her how nervous\\nand cross and out of sorts I felt, and she said I needed change and\\nless care, so Hannah is to help me with the children, and I\\'m to see to\\nthings about the house more, and now and then have a little fun, just\\nto keep me from getting to be a fidgety, broken-down old woman before\\nmy time.  It\\'s only an experiment, John, and I want to try it for your\\nsake as much as for mine, because I\\'ve neglected you shamefully lately,\\nand I\\'m going to make home what it used to be, if I can.  You don\\'t\\nobject, I hope?\"\\n\\nNever mind what John said, or what a very narrow escape the little\\nbonnet had from utter ruin.  All that we have any business to know is\\nthat John did not appear to object, judging from the changes which\\ngradually took place in the house and its inmates.  It was not all\\nParadise by any means, but everyone was better for the division of\\nlabor system.  The children throve under the paternal rule, for\\naccurate, steadfast John brought order and obedience into Babydom, while\\nMeg recovered her spirits and composed her nerves by plenty of\\nwholesome exercise, a little pleasure, and much confidential\\nconversation with her sensible husband.  Home grew homelike again, and\\nJohn had no wish to leave it, unless he took Meg with him.  The Scotts\\ncame to the Brookes\\' now, and everyone found the little house a\\ncheerful place, full of happiness, content, and family love.  Even\\nSallie Moffatt liked to go there.  \"It is always so quiet and pleasant\\nhere, it does me good, Meg,\" she used to say, looking about her with\\nwistful eyes, as if trying to discover the charm, that she might use it\\nin her great house, full of splendid loneliness, for there were no\\nriotous, sunny-faced babies there, and Ned lived in a world of his own,\\nwhere there was no place for her.\\n\\nThis household happiness did not come all at once, but John and Meg had\\nfound the key to it, and each year of married life taught them how to\\nuse it, unlocking the treasuries of real home love and mutual\\nhelpfulness, which the poorest may possess, and the richest cannot buy.\\nThis is the sort of shelf on which young wives and mothers may consent\\nto be laid, safe from the restless fret and fever of the world, finding\\nloyal lovers in the little sons and daughters who cling to them,\\nundaunted by sorrow, poverty, or age, walking side by side, through\\nfair and stormy weather, with a faithful friend, who is, in the true\\nsense of the good old Saxon word, the \\'house-band\\', and learning, as\\nMeg learned, that a woman\\'s happiest kingdom is home, her highest honor\\nthe art of ruling it not as a queen, but as a wise wife and mother.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'THIRTY-NINE\\n\\nLAZY LAURENCE\\n\\nLaurie went to Nice intending to stay a week, and remained a month.  He\\nwas tired of wandering about alone, and Amy\\'s familiar presence seemed\\nto give a homelike charm to the foreign scenes in which she bore a\\npart.  He rather missed the \\'petting\\' he used to receive, and enjoyed a\\ntaste of it again, for no attentions, however flattering, from\\nstrangers, were half so pleasant as the sisterly adoration of the girls\\nat home.  Amy never would pet him like the others, but she was very\\nglad to see him now, and quite clung to him, feeling that he was the\\nrepresentative of the dear family for whom she longed more than she\\nwould confess.  They naturally took comfort in each other\\'s society and\\nwere much together, riding, walking, dancing, or dawdling, for at Nice\\nno one can be very industrious during the gay season.  But, while\\napparently amusing themselves in the most careless fashion, they were\\nhalf-consciously making discoveries and forming opinions about each\\nother.  Amy rose daily in the estimation of her friend, but he sank in\\nhers, and each felt the truth before a word was spoken.  Amy tried to\\nplease, and succeeded, for she was grateful for the many pleasures he\\ngave her, and repaid him with the little services to which womanly\\nwomen know how to lend an indescribable charm.  Laurie made no effort\\nof any kind, but just let himself drift along as comfortably as\\npossible, trying to forget, and feeling that all women owed him a kind\\nword because one had been cold to him.  It cost him no effort to be\\ngenerous, and he would have given Amy all the trinkets in Nice if she\\nwould have taken them, but at the same time he felt that he could not\\nchange the opinion she was forming of him, and he rather dreaded the\\nkeen blue eyes that seemed to watch him with such half-sorrowful,\\nhalf-scornful surprise.\\n\\n\"All the rest have gone to Monaco for the day.  I preferred to stay at\\nhome and write letters.  They are done now, and I am going to Valrosa\\nto sketch, will you come?\" said Amy, as she joined Laurie one lovely\\nday when he lounged in as usual, about noon.\\n\\n\"Well, yes, but isn\\'t it rather warm for such a long walk?\" he answered\\nslowly, for the shaded salon looked inviting after the glare without.\\n\\n\"I\\'m going to have the little carriage, and Baptiste can drive, so\\nyou\\'ll have nothing to do but hold your umbrella, and keep your gloves\\nnice,\" returned Amy, with a sarcastic glance at the immaculate kids,\\nwhich were a weak point with Laurie.\\n\\n\"Then I\\'ll go with pleasure.\" and he put out his hand for her\\nsketchbook.  But she tucked it under her arm with a sharp...\\n\\n\"Don\\'t trouble yourself.  It\\'s no exertion to me, but you don\\'t look\\nequal to it.\"\\n\\nLaurie lifted his eyebrows and followed at a leisurely pace as she ran\\ndownstairs, but when they got into the carriage he took the reins\\nhimself, and left little Baptiste nothing to do but fold his arms and\\nfall asleep on his perch.\\n\\nThe two never quarreled.  Amy was too well-bred, and just now Laurie\\nwas too lazy, so in a minute he peeped under her hatbrim with an\\ninquiring air.  She answered him with a smile, and they went on\\ntogether in the most amicable manner.\\n\\nIt was a lovely drive, along winding roads rich in the picturesque\\nscenes that delight beauty-loving eyes.  Here an ancient monastery,\\nwhence the solemn chanting of the monks came down to them.  There a\\nbare-legged shepherd, in wooden shoes, pointed hat, and rough jacket\\nover one shoulder, sat piping on a stone while his goats skipped among\\nthe rocks or lay at his feet.  Meek, mouse-colored donkeys, laden with\\npanniers of freshly cut grass passed by, with a pretty girl in a\\ncapaline sitting between the green piles, or an old woman spinning with\\na distaff as she went. Brown, soft-eyed children ran out from the\\nquaint stone hovels to offer nosegays, or bunches of oranges still on\\nthe bough. Gnarled olive trees covered the hills with their dusky\\nfoliage, fruit hung golden in the orchard, and great scarlet anemones\\nfringed the roadside, while beyond green slopes and craggy heights, the\\nMaritime Alps rose sharp and white against the blue Italian sky.\\n\\nValrosa well deserved its name, for in that climate of perpetual summer\\nroses blossomed everywhere.  They overhung the archway, thrust\\nthemselves between the bars of the great gate with a sweet welcome to\\npassers-by, and lined the avenue, winding through lemon trees and\\nfeathery palms up to the villa on the hill. Every shadowy nook, where\\nseats invited one to stop and rest, was a mass of bloom, every cool\\ngrotto had its marble nymph smiling from a veil of flowers and every\\nfountain reflected crimson, white, or pale pink roses, leaning down to\\nsmile at their own beauty. Roses covered the walls of the house, draped\\nthe cornices, climbed the pillars, and ran riot over the balustrade of\\nthe wide terrace, whence one looked down on the sunny Mediterranean,\\nand the white-walled city on its shore.\\n\\n\"This is a regular honeymoon paradise, isn\\'t it?  Did you ever see such\\nroses?\" asked Amy, pausing on the terrace to enjoy the view, and a\\nluxurious whiff of perfume that came wandering by.\\n\\n\"No, nor felt such thorns,\" returned Laurie, with his thumb in his\\nmouth, after a vain attempt to capture a solitary scarlet flower that\\ngrew just beyond his reach.\\n\\n\"Try lower down, and pick those that have no thorns,\" said Amy,\\ngathering three of the tiny cream-colored ones that starred the wall\\nbehind her.  She put them in his buttonhole as a peace offering, and he\\nstood a minute looking down at them with a curious expression, for in\\nthe Italian part of his nature there was a touch of superstition, and\\nhe was just then in that state of half-sweet, half-bitter melancholy,\\nwhen imaginative young men find significance in trifles and food for\\nromance everywhere. He had thought of Jo in reaching after the thorny\\nred rose, for vivid flowers became her, and she had often worn ones\\nlike that from the greenhouse at home.  The pale roses Amy gave him\\nwere the sort that the Italians lay in dead hands, never in bridal\\nwreaths, and for a moment he wondered if the omen was for Jo or for\\nhimself, but the next instant his American common sense got the better\\nof sentimentality, and he laughed a heartier laugh than Amy had heard\\nsince he came.\\n\\n\"It\\'s good advice, you\\'d better take it and save your fingers,\" she\\nsaid, thinking her speech amused him.\\n\\n\"Thank you, I will,\" he answered in jest, and a few months later he did\\nit in earnest.\\n\\n\"Laurie, when are you going to your grandfather?\" she asked presently,\\nas she settled herself on a rustic seat.\\n\\n\"Very soon.\"\\n\\n\"You have said that a dozen times within the last three weeks.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say, short answers save trouble.\"\\n\\n\"He expects you, and you really ought to go.\"\\n\\n\"Hospitable creature!  I know it.\"\\n\\n\"Then why don\\'t you do it?\"\\n\\n\"Natural depravity, I suppose.\"\\n\\n\"Natural indolence, you mean.  It\\'s really dreadful!\" and Amy looked\\nsevere.\\n\\n\"Not so bad as it seems, for I should only plague him if I went, so I\\nmight as well stay and plague you a little longer, you can bear it\\nbetter, in fact I think it agrees with you excellently,\" and Laurie\\ncomposed himself for a lounge on the broad ledge of the balustrade.\\n\\nAmy shook her head and opened her sketchbook with an air of\\nresignation, but she had made up her mind to lecture \\'that boy\\' and in\\na minute she began again.\\n\\n\"What are you doing just now?\"\\n\\n\"Watching lizards.\"\\n\\n\"No, no.  I mean what do you intend and wish to do?\"\\n\\n\"Smoke a cigarette, if you\\'ll allow me.\"\\n\\n\"How provoking you are!  I don\\'t approve of cigars and I will only\\nallow it on condition that you let me put you into my sketch.  I need a\\nfigure.\"\\n\\n\"With all the pleasure in life.  How will you have me, full length or\\nthree-quarters, on my head or my heels?  I should respectfully suggest\\na recumbent posture, then put yourself in also and call it \\'Dolce far\\nniente\\'.\"\\n\\n\"Stay as you are, and go to sleep if you like.  I intend to work hard,\"\\nsaid Amy in her most energetic tone.\\n\\n\"What delightful enthusiasm!\" and he leaned against a tall urn with an\\nair of entire satisfaction.\\n\\n\"What would Jo say if she saw you now?\" asked Amy impatiently, hoping\\nto stir him up by the mention of her still more energetic sister\\'s name.\\n\\n\"As usual, \\'Go away, Teddy.  I\\'m busy!\\'\" He laughed as he spoke, but\\nthe laugh was not natural, and a shade passed over his face, for the\\nutterance of the familiar name touched the wound that was not healed\\nyet.  Both tone and shadow struck Amy, for she had seen and heard them\\nbefore, and now she looked up in time to catch a new expression on\\nLaurie\\'s face--a hard bitter look, full of pain, dissatisfaction, and\\nregret.  It was gone before she could study it and the listless\\nexpression back again. She watched him for a moment with artistic\\npleasure, thinking how like an Italian he looked, as he lay basking in\\nthe sun with uncovered head and eyes full of southern dreaminess, for\\nhe seemed to have forgotten her and fallen into a reverie.\\n\\n\"You look like the effigy of a young knight asleep on his tomb,\" she\\nsaid, carefully tracing the well-cut profile defined against the dark\\nstone.\\n\\n\"Wish I was!\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s a foolish wish, unless you have spoiled your life. You are so\\nchanged, I sometimes think--\" there Amy stopped, with a half-timid,\\nhalf-wistful look, more significant than her unfinished speech.\\n\\nLaurie saw and understood the affectionate anxiety which she hesitated\\nto express, and looking straight into her eyes, said, just as he used\\nto say it to her mother, \"It\\'s all right, ma\\'am.\"\\n\\nThat satisfied her and set at rest the doubts that had begun to worry\\nher lately.  It also touched her, and she showed that it did, by the\\ncordial tone in which she said...\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad of that!  I didn\\'t think you\\'d been a very bad boy, but I\\nfancied you might have wasted money at that wicked Baden-Baden, lost\\nyour heart to some charming Frenchwoman with a husband, or got into\\nsome of the scrapes that young men seem to consider a necessary part of\\na foreign tour.  Don\\'t stay out there in the sun, come and lie on the\\ngrass here and \\'let us be friendly\\', as Jo used to say when we got in\\nthe sofa corner and told secrets.\"\\n\\nLaurie obediently threw himself down on the turf, and began to amuse\\nhimself by sticking daisies into the ribbons of Amy\\'s hat, that lay\\nthere.\\n\\n\"I\\'m all ready for the secrets.\" and he glanced up with a decided\\nexpression of interest in his eyes.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve none to tell.  You may begin.\"\\n\\n\"Haven\\'t one to bless myself with.  I thought perhaps you\\'d had some\\nnews from home..\"\\n\\n\"You have heard all that has come lately.  Don\\'t you hear often?  I\\nfancied Jo would send you volumes.\"\\n\\n\"She\\'s very busy.  I\\'m roving about so, it\\'s impossible to be regular,\\nyou know.  When do you begin your great work of art, Raphaella?\" he\\nasked, changing the subject abruptly after another pause, in which he\\nhad been wondering if Amy knew his secret and wanted to talk about it.\\n\\n\"Never,\" she answered, with a despondent but decided air. \"Rome took\\nall the vanity out of me, for after seeing the wonders there, I felt\\ntoo insignificant to live and gave up all my foolish hopes in despair.\"\\n\\n\"Why should you, with so much energy and talent?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s just why, because talent isn\\'t genius, and no amount of energy\\ncan make it so.  I want to be great, or nothing. I won\\'t be a\\ncommon-place dauber, so I don\\'t intend to try any more.\"\\n\\n\"And what are you going to do with yourself now, if I may ask?\"\\n\\n\"Polish up my other talents, and be an ornament to society, if I get\\nthe chance.\"\\n\\nIt was a characteristic speech, and sounded daring, but audacity\\nbecomes young people, and Amy\\'s ambition had a good foundation.  Laurie\\nsmiled, but he liked the spirit with which she took up a new purpose\\nwhen a long-cherished one died, and spent no time lamenting.\\n\\n\"Good!  And here is where Fred Vaughn comes in, I fancy.\"\\n\\nAmy preserved a discreet silence, but there was a conscious look in her\\ndowncast face that made Laurie sit up and say gravely, \"Now I\\'m going\\nto play brother, and ask questions.  May I?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t promise to answer.\"\\n\\n\"Your face will, if your tongue won\\'t.  You aren\\'t woman of the world\\nenough yet to hide your feelings, my dear.  I heard rumors about Fred\\nand you last year, and it\\'s my private opinion that if he had not been\\ncalled home so suddenly and detained so long, something would have come\\nof it, hey?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s not for me to say,\" was Amy\\'s grim reply, but her lips would\\nsmile, and there was a traitorous sparkle of the eye which betrayed\\nthat she knew her power and enjoyed the knowledge.\\n\\n\"You are not engaged, I hope?\" and Laurie looked very elder-brotherly\\nand grave all of a sudden.\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"But you will be, if he comes back and goes properly down on his knees,\\nwon\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Very likely.\"\\n\\n\"Then you are fond of old Fred?\"\\n\\n\"I could be, if I tried.\"\\n\\n\"But you don\\'t intend to try till the proper moment? Bless my soul,\\nwhat unearthly prudence!  He\\'s a good fellow, Amy, but not the man I\\nfancied you\\'d like.\"\\n\\n\"He is rich, a gentleman, and has delightful manners,\" began Amy,\\ntrying to be quite cool and dignified, but feeling a little ashamed of\\nherself, in spite of the sincerity of her intentions.\\n\\n\"I understand.  Queens of society can\\'t get on without money, so you\\nmean to make a good match, and start in that way?  Quite right and\\nproper, as the world goes, but it sounds odd from the lips of one of\\nyour mother\\'s girls.\"\\n\\n\"True, nevertheless.\"\\n\\nA short speech, but the quiet decision with which it was uttered\\ncontrasted curiously with the young speaker.  Laurie felt this\\ninstinctively and laid himself down again, with a sense of\\ndisappointment which he could not explain.  His look and silence, as\\nwell as a certain inward self-disapproval, ruffled Amy, and made her\\nresolve to deliver her lecture without delay.\\n\\n\"I wish you\\'d do me the favor to rouse yourself a little,\" she said\\nsharply.\\n\\n\"Do it for me, there\\'s a dear girl.\"\\n\\n\"I could, if I tried.\" and she looked as if she would like doing it in\\nthe most summary style.\\n\\n\"Try, then.  I give you leave,\" returned Laurie, who enjoyed having\\nsomeone to tease, after his long abstinence from his favorite pastime.\\n\\n\"You\\'d be angry in five minutes.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m never angry with you.  It takes two flints to make a fire. You are\\nas cool and soft as snow.\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t know what I can do.  Snow produces a glow and a tingle, if\\napplied rightly.  Your indifference is half affectation, and a good\\nstirring up would prove it.\"\\n\\n\"Stir away, it won\\'t hurt me and it may amuse you, as the big man said\\nwhen his little wife beat him.  Regard me in the light of a husband or\\na carpet, and beat till you are tired, if that sort of exercise agrees\\nwith you.\"\\n\\nBeing decidedly nettled herself, and longing to see him shake off the\\napathy that so altered him, Amy sharpened both tongue and pencil, and\\nbegan.\\n\\n\"Flo and I have got a new name for you.  It\\'s Lazy Laurence. How do you\\nlike it?\"\\n\\nShe thought it would annoy him, but he only folded his arms under his\\nhead, with an imperturbable, \"That\\'s not bad. Thank you, ladies.\"\\n\\n\"Do you want to know what I honestly think of you?\"\\n\\n\"Pining to be told.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I despise you.\"\\n\\nIf she had even said \\'I hate you\\' in a petulant or coquettish tone, he\\nwould have laughed and rather liked it, but the grave, almost sad,\\naccent in her voice made him open his eyes, and ask quickly...\\n\\n\"Why, if you please?\"\\n\\n\"Because, with every chance for being good, useful, and happy, you are\\nfaulty, lazy, and miserable.\"\\n\\n\"Strong language, mademoiselle.\"\\n\\n\"If you like it, I\\'ll go on.\"\\n\\n\"Pray do, it\\'s quite interesting.\"\\n\\n\"I thought you\\'d find it so.  Selfish people always like to talk about\\nthemselves.\"\\n\\n\"Am I selfish?\" the question slipped out involuntarily and in a tone of\\nsurprise, for the one virtue on which he prided himself was generosity.\\n\\n\"Yes, very selfish,\" continued Amy, in a calm, cool voice, twice as\\neffective just then as an angry one.  \"I\\'ll show you how, for I\\'ve\\nstudied you while we were frolicking, and I\\'m not at all satisfied with\\nyou.  Here you have been abroad nearly six months, and done nothing but\\nwaste time and money and disappoint your friends.\"\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t a fellow to have any pleasure after a four-year grind?\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t look as if you\\'d had much.  At any rate, you are none the\\nbetter for it, as far as I can see.  I said when we first met that you\\nhad improved.  Now I take it all back, for I don\\'t think you half so\\nnice as when I left you at home.  You have grown abominably lazy, you\\nlike gossip, and waste time on frivolous things, you are contented to\\nbe petted and admired by silly people, instead of being loved and\\nrespected by wise ones.  With money, talent, position, health, and\\nbeauty, ah you like that old Vanity!  But it\\'s the truth, so I can\\'t\\nhelp saying it, with all these splendid things to use and enjoy, you\\ncan find nothing to do but dawdle, and instead of being the man you\\nought to be, you are only...\"  there she stopped, with a look that had\\nboth pain and pity in it.\\n\\n\"Saint Laurence on a gridiron,\" added Laurie, blandly finishing the\\nsentence.  But the lecture began to take effect, for there was a\\nwide-awake sparkle in his eyes now and a half-angry, half-injured\\nexpression replaced the former indifference.\\n\\n\"I supposed you\\'d take it so.  You men tell us we are angels, and say\\nwe can make you what we will, but the instant we honestly try to do you\\ngood, you laugh at us and won\\'t listen, which proves how much your\\nflattery is worth.\" Amy spoke bitterly, and turned her back on the\\nexasperating martyr at her feet.\\n\\nIn a minute a hand came down over the page, so that she could not draw,\\nand Laurie\\'s voice said, with a droll imitation of a penitent child, \"I\\nwill be good, oh, I will be good!\"\\n\\nBut Amy did not laugh, for she was in earnest, and tapping on the\\noutspread hand with her pencil, said soberly, \"Aren\\'t you ashamed of a\\nhand like that?  It\\'s as soft and white as a woman\\'s, and looks as if\\nit never did anything but wear Jouvin\\'s best gloves and pick flowers\\nfor ladies.  You are not a dandy, thank Heaven, so I\\'m glad to see\\nthere are no diamonds or big seal rings on it, only the little old one\\nJo gave you so long ago.  Dear soul, I wish she was here to help me!\"\\n\\n\"So do I!\"\\n\\nThe hand vanished as suddenly as it came, and there was energy enough\\nin the echo of her wish to suit even Amy.  She glanced down at him with\\na new thought in her mind, but he was lying with his hat half over his\\nface, as if for shade, and his mustache hid his mouth.  She only saw\\nhis chest rise and fall, with a long breath that might have been a\\nsigh, and the hand that wore the ring nestled down into the grass, as\\nif to hide something too precious or too tender to be spoken of. All in\\na minute various hints and trifles assumed shape and significance in\\nAmy\\'s mind, and told her what her sister never had confided to her.\\nShe remembered that Laurie never spoke voluntarily of Jo, she recalled\\nthe shadow on his face just now, the change in his character, and the\\nwearing of the little old ring which was no ornament to a handsome\\nhand.  Girls are quick to read such signs and feel their eloquence.\\nAmy had fancied that perhaps a love trouble was at the bottom of the\\nalteration, and now she was sure of it.  Her keen eyes filled, and when\\nshe spoke again, it was in a voice that could be beautifully soft and\\nkind when she chose to make it so.\\n\\n\"I know I have no right to talk so to you, Laurie, and if you weren\\'t\\nthe sweetest-tempered fellow in the world, you\\'d be very angry with me.\\nBut we are all so fond and proud of you, I couldn\\'t bear to think they\\nshould be disappointed in you at home as I have been, though, perhaps\\nthey would understand the change better than I do.\"\\n\\n\"I think they would,\" came from under the hat, in a grim tone, quite as\\ntouching as a broken one.\\n\\n\"They ought to have told me, and not let me go blundering and scolding,\\nwhen I should have been more kind and patient than ever.  I never did\\nlike that Miss Randal and now I hate her!\" said artful Amy, wishing to\\nbe sure of her facts this time.\\n\\n\"Hang Miss Randal!\" and Laurie knocked the hat off his face with a look\\nthat left no doubt of his sentiments toward that young lady.\\n\\n\"I beg pardon, I thought...\" and there she paused diplomatically.\\n\\n\"No, you didn\\'t, you knew perfectly well I never cared for anyone but\\nJo,\" Laurie said that in his old, impetuous tone, and turned his face\\naway as he spoke.\\n\\n\"I did think so, but as they never said anything about it, and you came\\naway, I supposed I was mistaken.  And Jo wouldn\\'t be kind to you?  Why,\\nI was sure she loved you dearly.\"\\n\\n\"She was kind, but not in the right way, and it\\'s lucky for her she\\ndidn\\'t love me, if I\\'m the good-for-nothing fellow you think me.  It\\'s\\nher fault though, and you may tell her so.\"\\n\\nThe hard, bitter look came back again as he said that, and it troubled\\nAmy, for she did not know what balm to apply.\\n\\n\"I was wrong, I didn\\'t know.  I\\'m very sorry I was so cross, but I\\ncan\\'t help wishing you\\'d bear it better, Teddy, dear.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t, that\\'s her name for me!\" and Laurie put up his hand with a\\nquick gesture to stop the words spoken in Jo\\'s half-kind,\\nhalf-reproachful tone.  \"Wait till you\\'ve tried it yourself,\" he added\\nin a low voice, as he pulled up the grass by the handful.\\n\\n\"I\\'d take it manfully, and be respected if I couldn\\'t be loved,\" said\\nAmy, with the decision of one who knew nothing about it.\\n\\nNow, Laurie flattered himself that he had borne it remarkably well,\\nmaking no moan, asking no sympathy, and taking his trouble away to live\\nit down alone.  Amy\\'s lecture put the matter in a new light, and for\\nthe first time it did look weak and selfish to lose heart at the first\\nfailure, and shut himself up in moody indifference.  He felt as if\\nsuddenly shaken out of a pensive dream and found it impossible to go to\\nsleep again.  Presently he sat up and asked slowly, \"Do you think Jo\\nwould despise me as you do?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, if she saw you now.  She hates lazy people.  Why don\\'t you do\\nsomething splendid, and make her love you?\"\\n\\n\"I did my best, but it was no use.\"\\n\\n\"Graduating well, you mean?  That was no more than you ought to have\\ndone, for your grandfather\\'s sake.  It would have been shameful to fail\\nafter spending so much time and money, when everyone knew that you\\ncould do well.\"\\n\\n\"I did fail, say what you will, for Jo wouldn\\'t love me,\" began Laurie,\\nleaning his head on his hand in a despondent attitude.\\n\\n\"No, you didn\\'t, and you\\'ll say so in the end, for it did you good, and\\nproved that you could do something if you tried. If you\\'d only set\\nabout another task of some sort, you\\'d soon be your hearty, happy self\\nagain, and forget your trouble.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s impossible.\"\\n\\n\"Try it and see.  You needn\\'t shrug your shoulders, and think, \\'Much\\nshe knows about such things\\'.  I don\\'t pretend to be wise, but I am\\nobserving, and I see a great deal more than you\\'d imagine.  I\\'m\\ninterested in other people\\'s experiences and inconsistencies, and\\nthough I can\\'t explain, I remember and use them for my own benefit.\\nLove Jo all your days, if you choose, but don\\'t let it spoil you, for\\nit\\'s wicked to throw away so many good gifts because you can\\'t have the\\none you want.  There, I won\\'t lecture any more, for I know you\\'ll wake\\nup and be a man in spite of that hardhearted girl.\"\\n\\nNeither spoke for several minutes.  Laurie sat turning the little ring\\non his finger, and Amy put the last touches to the hasty sketch she had\\nbeen working at while she talked. Presently she put it on his knee,\\nmerely saying, \"How do you like that?\"\\n\\nHe looked and then he smiled, as he could not well help doing, for it\\nwas capitally done, the long, lazy figure on the grass, with listless\\nface, half-shut eyes, and one hand holding a cigar, from which came the\\nlittle wreath of smoke that encircled the dreamer\\'s head.\\n\\n\"How well you draw!\" he said, with a genuine surprise and pleasure at\\nher skill, adding, with a half-laugh, \"Yes, that\\'s me.\"\\n\\n\"As you are.  This is as you were.\" and Amy laid another sketch beside\\nthe one he held.\\n\\nIt was not nearly so well done, but there was a life and spirit in it\\nwhich atoned for many faults, and it recalled the past so vividly that\\na sudden change swept over the young man\\'s face as he looked.  Only a\\nrough sketch of Laurie taming a horse.  Hat and coat were off, and\\nevery line of the active figure, resolute face, and commanding attitude\\nwas full of energy and meaning.  The handsome brute, just subdued,\\nstood arching his neck under the tightly drawn rein, with one foot\\nimpatiently pawing the ground, and ears pricked up as if listening for\\nthe voice that had mastered him.  In the ruffled mane, the rider\\'s\\nbreezy hair and erect attitude, there was a suggestion of suddenly\\narrested motion, of strength, courage, and youthful buoyancy that\\ncontrasted sharply with the supine grace of the \\'_Dolce far Niente_\\'\\nsketch.  Laurie said nothing but as his eye went from one to the other,\\nAmy saw him flush up and fold his lips together as if he read and\\naccepted the little lesson she had given him.  That satisfied her, and\\nwithout waiting for him to speak, she said, in her sprightly way...\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you remember the day you played Rarey with Puck, and we all\\nlooked on?  Meg and Beth were frightened, but Jo clapped and pranced,\\nand I sat on the fence and drew you.  I found that sketch in my\\nportfolio the other day, touched it up, and kept it to show you.\"\\n\\n\"Much obliged.  You\\'ve improved immensely since then, and I\\ncongratulate you.  May I venture to suggest in \\'a honeymoon paradise\\'\\nthat five o\\'clock is the dinner hour at your hotel?\"\\n\\nLaurie rose as he spoke, returned the pictures with a smile and a bow\\nand looked at his watch, as if to remind her that even moral lectures\\nshould have an end.  He tried to resume his former easy, indifferent\\nair, but it was an affectation now, for the rousing had been more\\neffacious than he would confess.  Amy felt the shade of coldness in his\\nmanner, and said to herself...\\n\\n\"Now, I\\'ve offended him.  Well, if it does him good, I\\'m glad, if it\\nmakes him hate me, I\\'m sorry, but it\\'s true, and I can\\'t take back a\\nword of it.\"\\n\\nThey laughed and chatted all the way home, and little Baptiste, up\\nbehind, thought that monsieur and madamoiselle were in charming\\nspirits.  But both felt ill at ease.  The friendly frankness was\\ndisturbed, the sunshine had a shadow over it, and despite their\\napparent gaiety, there was a secret discontent in the heart of each.\\n\\n\"Shall we see you this evening, mon frere?\" asked Amy, as they parted\\nat her aunt\\'s door.\\n\\n\"Unfortunately I have an engagement.  Au revoir, madamoiselle,\" and\\nLaurie bent as if to kiss her hand, in the foreign fashion, which\\nbecame him better than many men.  Something in his face made Amy say\\nquickly and warmly...\\n\\n\"No, be yourself with me, Laurie, and part in the good old way. I\\'d\\nrather have a hearty English handshake than all the sentimental\\nsalutations in France.\"\\n\\n\"Goodbye, dear,\" and with these words, uttered in the tone she liked,\\nLaurie left her, after a handshake almost painful in its heartiness.\\n\\nNext morning, instead of the usual call, Amy received a note which made\\nher smile at the beginning and sigh at the end.\\n\\nMy Dear Mentor, Please make my adieux to your aunt, and exult within\\nyourself, for \\'Lazy Laurence\\' has gone to his grandpa, like the best of\\nboys.  A pleasant winter to you, and may the gods grant you a blissful\\nhoneymoon at Valrosa!  I think Fred would be benefited by a rouser.\\nTell him so, with my congratulations.\\n\\nYours gratefully, Telemachus\\n\\n\\n\"Good boy!  I\\'m glad he\\'s gone,\" said Amy, with an approving smile. The\\nnext minute her face fell as she glanced about the empty room, adding,\\nwith an involuntary sigh, \"Yes, I am glad, but how I shall miss him.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'FORTY\\n\\nTHE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW\\n\\nWhen the first bitterness was over, the family accepted the inevitable,\\nand tried to bear it cheerfully, helping one another by the increased\\naffection which comes to bind households tenderly together in times of\\ntrouble.  They put away their grief, and each did his or her part\\ntoward making that last year a happy one.\\n\\nThe pleasantest room in the house was set apart for Beth, and in it was\\ngathered everything that she most loved, flowers, pictures, her piano,\\nthe little worktable, and the beloved pussies.  Father\\'s best books\\nfound their way there, Mother\\'s easy chair, Jo\\'s desk, Amy\\'s finest\\nsketches, and every day Meg brought her babies on a loving pilgrimage,\\nto make sunshine for Aunty Beth.  John quietly set apart a little sum,\\nthat he might enjoy the pleasure of keeping the invalid supplied with\\nthe fruit she loved and longed for.  Old Hannah never wearied of\\nconcocting dainty dishes to tempt a capricious appetite, dropping tears\\nas she worked, and from across the sea came little gifts and cheerful\\nletters, seeming to bring breaths of warmth and fragrance from lands\\nthat know no winter.\\n\\nHere, cherished like a household saint in its shrine, sat Beth,\\ntranquil and busy as ever, for nothing could change the sweet,\\nunselfish nature, and even while preparing to leave life, she tried to\\nmake it happier for those who should remain behind.  The feeble fingers\\nwere never idle, and one of her pleasures was to make little things for\\nthe school children daily passing to and fro, to drop a pair of mittens\\nfrom her window for a pair of purple hands, a needlebook for some small\\nmother of many dolls, penwipers for young penmen toiling through\\nforests of pothooks, scrapbooks for picture-loving eyes, and all manner\\nof pleasant devices, till the reluctant climbers of the ladder of\\nlearning found their way strewn with flowers, as it were, and came to\\nregard the gentle giver as a sort of fairy godmother, who sat above\\nthere, and showered down gifts miraculously suited to their tastes and\\nneeds.  If Beth had wanted any reward, she found it in the bright\\nlittle faces always turned up to her window, with nods and smiles, and\\nthe droll little letters which came to her, full of blots and gratitude.\\n\\nThe first few months were very happy ones, and Beth often used to look\\nround, and say \"How beautiful this is!\" as they all sat together in her\\nsunny room, the babies kicking and crowing on the floor, mother and\\nsisters working near, and father reading, in his pleasant voice, from\\nthe wise old books which seemed rich in good and comfortable words, as\\napplicable now as when written centuries ago, a little chapel, where a\\npaternal priest taught his flock the hard lessons all must learn,\\ntrying to show them that hope can comfort love, and faith make\\nresignation possible.  Simple sermons, that went straight to the souls\\nof those who listened, for the father\\'s heart was in the minister\\'s\\nreligion, and the frequent falter in the voice gave a double eloquence\\nto the words he spoke or read.\\n\\nIt was well for all that this peaceful time was given them as\\npreparation for the sad hours to come, for by-and-by, Beth said the\\nneedle was \\'so heavy\\', and put it down forever.  Talking wearied her,\\nfaces troubled her, pain claimed her for its own, and her tranquil\\nspirit was sorrowfully perturbed by the ills that vexed her feeble\\nflesh.  Ah me! Such heavy days, such long, long nights, such aching\\nhearts and imploring prayers, when those who loved her best were forced\\nto see the thin hands stretched out to them beseechingly, to hear the\\nbitter cry, \"Help me, help me!\" and to feel that there was no help.  A\\nsad eclipse of the serene soul, a sharp struggle of the young life with\\ndeath, but both were mercifully brief, and then the natural rebellion\\nover, the old peace returned more beautiful than ever.  With the wreck\\nof her frail body, Beth\\'s soul grew strong, and though she said little,\\nthose about her felt that she was ready, saw that the first pilgrim\\ncalled was likewise the fittest, and waited with her on the shore,\\ntrying to see the Shining Ones coming to receive her when she crossed\\nthe river.\\n\\nJo never left her for an hour since Beth had said \"I feel stronger when\\nyou are here.\"  She slept on a couch in the room, waking often to renew\\nthe fire, to feed, lift, or wait upon the patient creature who seldom\\nasked for anything, and \\'tried not to be a trouble\\'.  All day she\\nhaunted the room, jealous of any other nurse, and prouder of being\\nchosen then than of any honor her life ever brought her.  Precious and\\nhelpful hours to Jo, for now her heart received the teaching that it\\nneeded.  Lessons in patience were so sweetly taught her that she could\\nnot fail to learn them, charity for all, the lovely spirit that can\\nforgive and truly forget unkindness, the loyalty to duty that makes the\\nhardest easy, and the sincere faith that fears nothing, but trusts\\nundoubtingly.\\n\\nOften when she woke Jo found Beth reading in her well-worn little book,\\nheard her singing softly, to beguile the sleepless night, or saw her\\nlean her face upon her hands, while slow tears dropped through the\\ntransparent fingers, and Jo would lie watching her with thoughts too\\ndeep for tears, feeling that Beth, in her simple, unselfish way, was\\ntrying to wean herself from the dear old life, and fit herself for the\\nlife to come, by sacred words of comfort, quiet prayers, and the music\\nshe loved so well.\\n\\nSeeing this did more for Jo than the wisest sermons, the saintliest\\nhymns, the most fervent prayers that any voice could utter.  For with\\neyes made clear by many tears, and a heart softened by the tenderest\\nsorrow, she recognized the beauty of her sister\\'s life--uneventful,\\nunambitious, yet full of the genuine virtues which \\'smell sweet, and\\nblossom in the dust\\', the self-forgetfulness that makes the humblest on\\nearth remembered soonest in heaven, the true success which is possible\\nto all.\\n\\nOne night when Beth looked among the books upon her table, to find\\nsomething to make her forget the mortal weariness that was almost as\\nhard to bear as pain, as she turned the leaves of her old favorite,\\nPilgrims\\'s Progress, she found a little paper, scribbled over in Jo\\'s\\nhand.  The name caught her eye and the blurred look of the lines made\\nher sure that tears had fallen on it.\\n\\n\"Poor Jo!  She\\'s fast asleep, so I won\\'t wake her to ask leave.  She\\nshows me all her things, and I don\\'t think she\\'ll mind if I look at\\nthis\", thought Beth, with a glance at her sister, who lay on the rug,\\nwith the tongs beside her, ready to wake up the minute the log fell\\napart.\\n\\n    MY BETH\\n\\n    Sitting patient in the shadow\\n    Till the blessed light shall come,\\n    A serene and saintly presence\\n    Sanctifies our troubled home.\\n    Earthly joys and hopes and sorrows\\n    Break like ripples on the strand\\n    Of the deep and solemn river\\n    Where her willing feet now stand.\\n\\n    O my sister, passing from me,\\n    Out of human care and strife,\\n    Leave me, as a gift, those virtues\\n    Which have beautified your life.\\n    Dear, bequeath me that great patience\\n    Which has power to sustain\\n    A cheerful, uncomplaining spirit\\n    In its prison-house of pain.\\n\\n    Give me, for I need it sorely,\\n    Of that courage, wise and sweet,\\n    Which has made the path of duty\\n    Green beneath your willing feet.\\n    Give me that unselfish nature,\\n    That with charity divine\\n    Can pardon wrong for love\\'s dear sake--\\n    Meek heart, forgive me mine!\\n\\n    Thus our parting daily loseth\\n    Something of its bitter pain,\\n    And while learning this hard lesson,\\n    My great loss becomes my gain.\\n    For the touch of grief will render\\n    My wild nature more serene,\\n    Give to life new aspirations,\\n    A new trust in the unseen.\\n\\n    Henceforth, safe across the river,\\n    I shall see forever more\\n    A beloved, household spirit\\n    Waiting for me on the shore.\\n    Hope and faith, born of my sorrow,\\n    Guardian angels shall become,\\n    And the sister gone before me\\n    By their hands shall lead me home.\\n\\nBlurred and blotted, faulty and feeble as the lines were, they brought\\na look of inexpressible comfort to Beth\\'s face, for her one regret had\\nbeen that she had done so little, and this seemed to assure her that\\nher life had not been useless, that her death would not bring the\\ndespair she feared.  As she sat with the paper folded between her\\nhands, the charred log fell asunder.  Jo started up, revived the blaze,\\nand crept to the bedside, hoping Beth slept.\\n\\n\"Not asleep, but so happy, dear.  See, I found this and read it. I knew\\nyou wouldn\\'t care.  Have I been all that to you, Jo?\" she asked, with\\nwistful, humble earnestness.\\n\\n\"_Oh_, Beth, so much, so much!\" and Jo\\'s head went down upon the pillow\\nbeside her sister\\'s.\\n\\n\"Then I don\\'t feel as if I\\'d wasted my life.  I\\'m not so good as you\\nmake me, but I have tried to do right.  And now, when it\\'s too late to\\nbegin even to do better, it\\'s such a comfort to know that someone loves\\nme so much, and feels as if I\\'d helped them.\"\\n\\n\"More than any one in the world, Beth.  I used to think I couldn\\'t let\\nyou go, but I\\'m learning to feel that I don\\'t lose you, that you\\'ll be\\nmore to me than ever, and death can\\'t part us, though it seems to.\"\\n\\n\"I know it cannot, and I don\\'t fear it any longer, for I\\'m sure I shall\\nbe your Beth still, to love and help you more than ever.  You must take\\nmy place, Jo, and be everything to Father and Mother when I\\'m gone.\\nThey will turn to you, don\\'t fail them, and if it\\'s hard to work alone,\\nremember that I don\\'t forget you, and that you\\'ll be happier in doing\\nthat than writing splendid books or seeing all the world, for love is\\nthe only thing that we can carry with us when we go, and it makes the\\nend so easy.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll try, Beth.\" and then and there Jo renounced her old ambition,\\npledged herself to a new and better one, acknowledging the poverty of\\nother desires, and feeling the blessed solace of a belief in the\\nimmortality of love.\\n\\nSo the spring days came and went, the sky grew clearer, the earth\\ngreener, the flowers were up fairly early, and the birds came back in\\ntime to say goodbye to Beth, who, like a tired but trustful child,\\nclung to the hands that had led her all her life, as Father and Mother\\nguided her tenderly through the Valley of the Shadow, and gave her up\\nto God.\\n\\nSeldom except in books do the dying utter memorable words, see visions,\\nor depart with beatified countenances, and those who have sped many\\nparting souls know that to most the end comes as naturally and simply\\nas sleep.  As Beth had hoped, the \\'tide went out easily\\', and in the\\ndark hour before dawn, on the bosom where she had drawn her first\\nbreath, she quietly drew her last, with no farewell but one loving\\nlook, one little sigh.\\n\\nWith tears and prayers and tender hands, Mother and sisters made her\\nready for the long sleep that pain would never mar again, seeing with\\ngrateful eyes the beautiful serenity that soon replaced the pathetic\\npatience that had wrung their hearts so long, and feeling with reverent\\njoy that to their darling death was a benignant angel, not a phantom\\nfull of dread.\\n\\nWhen morning came, for the first time in many months the fire was out,\\nJo\\'s place was empty, and the room was very still.  But a bird sang\\nblithely on a budding bough, close by, the snowdrops blossomed freshly\\nat the window, and the spring sunshine streamed in like a benediction\\nover the placid face upon the pillow, a face so full of painless peace\\nthat those who loved it best smiled through their tears, and thanked\\nGod that Beth was well at last.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'FORTY-ONE\\n\\nLEARNING TO FORGET\\n\\nAmy\\'s lecture did Laurie good, though, of course, he did not own it\\ntill long afterward.  Men seldom do, for when women are the advisers,\\nthe lords of creation don\\'t take the advice till they have persuaded\\nthemselves that it is just what they intended to do.  Then they act\\nupon it, and, if it succeeds, they give the weaker vessel half the\\ncredit of it.  If it fails, they generously give her the whole.  Laurie\\nwent back to his grandfather, and was so dutifully devoted for several\\nweeks that the old gentleman declared the climate of Nice had improved\\nhim wonderfully, and he had better try it again. There was nothing the\\nyoung gentleman would have liked better, but elephants could not have\\ndragged him back after the scolding he had received.  Pride forbid, and\\nwhenever the longing grew very strong, he fortified his resolution by\\nrepeating the words that had made the deepest impression--\"I despise\\nyou.\" \"Go and do something splendid that will make her love you.\"\\n\\nLaurie turned the matter over in his mind so often that he soon brought\\nhimself to confess that he had been selfish and lazy, but then when a\\nman has a great sorrow, he should be indulged in all sorts of vagaries\\ntill he has lived it down.  He felt that his blighted affections were\\nquite dead now, and though he should never cease to be a faithful\\nmourner, there was no occasion to wear his weeds ostentatiously.  Jo\\nwouldn\\'t love him, but he might make her respect and admire him by\\ndoing something which should prove that a girl\\'s \\'No\\' had not spoiled\\nhis life.  He had always meant to do something, and Amy\\'s advice was\\nquite unnecessary.  He had only been waiting till the aforesaid\\nblighted affections were decently interred. That being done, he felt\\nthat he was ready to \\'hide his stricken heart, and still toil on\\'.\\n\\nAs Goethe, when he had a joy or a grief, put it into a song, so Laurie\\nresolved to embalm his love sorrow in music, and to compose a Requiem\\nwhich should harrow up Jo\\'s soul and melt the heart of every hearer.\\nTherefore the next time the old gentleman found him getting restless\\nand moody and ordered him off, he went to Vienna, where he had musical\\nfriends, and fell to work with the firm determination to distinguish\\nhimself.  But whether the sorrow was too vast to be embodied in music,\\nor music too ethereal to uplift a mortal woe, he soon discovered that\\nthe Requiem was beyond him just at present.  It was evident that his\\nmind was not in working order yet, and his ideas needed clarifying, for\\noften in the middle of a plaintive strain, he would find himself\\nhumming a dancing tune that vividly recalled the Christmas ball at\\nNice, especially the stout Frenchman, and put an effectual stop to\\ntragic composition for the time being.\\n\\nThen he tried an opera, for nothing seemed impossible in the beginning,\\nbut here again unforeseen difficulties beset him.  He wanted Jo for his\\nheroine, and called upon his memory to supply him with tender\\nrecollections and romantic visions of his love.  But memory turned\\ntraitor, and as if possessed by the perverse spirit of the girl, would\\nonly recall Jo\\'s oddities, faults, and freaks, would only show her in\\nthe most unsentimental aspects--beating mats with her head tied up in a\\nbandanna, barricading herself with the sofa pillow, or throwing cold\\nwater over his passion a la Gummidge--and an irresistable laugh spoiled\\nthe pensive picture he was endeavoring to paint.  Jo wouldn\\'t be put\\ninto the opera at any price, and he had to give her up with a \"Bless\\nthat girl, what a torment she is!\" and a clutch at his hair, as became\\na distracted composer.\\n\\nWhen he looked about him for another and a less intractable damsel to\\nimmortalize in melody, memory produced one with the most obliging\\nreadiness.  This phantom wore many faces, but it always had golden\\nhair, was enveloped in a diaphanous cloud, and floated airily before\\nhis mind\\'s eye in a pleasing chaos of roses, peacocks, white ponies,\\nand blue ribbons.  He did not give the complacent wraith any name, but\\nhe took her for his heroine and grew quite fond of her, as well he\\nmight, for he gifted her with every gift and grace under the sun, and\\nescorted her, unscathed, through trials which would have annihilated\\nany mortal woman.\\n\\nThanks to this inspiration, he got on swimmingly for a time, but\\ngradually the work lost its charm, and he forgot to compose, while he\\nsat musing, pen in hand, or roamed about the gay city to get some new\\nideas and refresh his mind, which seemed to be in a somewhat unsettled\\nstate that winter.  He did not do much, but he thought a great deal and\\nwas conscious of a change of some sort going on in spite of himself.\\n\"It\\'s genius simmering, perhaps.  I\\'ll let it simmer, and see what\\ncomes of it,\" he said, with a secret suspicion all the while that it\\nwasn\\'t genius, but something far more common.  Whatever it was, it\\nsimmered to some purpose, for he grew more and more discontented with\\nhis desultory life, began to long for some real and earnest work to go\\nat, soul and body, and finally came to the wise conclusion that\\neveryone who loved music was not a composer.  Returning from one of\\nMozart\\'s grand operas, splendidly performed at the Royal Theatre, he\\nlooked over his own, played a few of the best parts, sat staring at the\\nbusts of Mendelssohn, Beethoven, and Bach, who stared benignly back\\nagain.  Then suddenly he tore up his music sheets, one by one, and as\\nthe last fluttered out of his hand, he said soberly to himself...\\n\\n\"She is right!  Talent isn\\'t genius, and you can\\'t make it so.  That\\nmusic has taken the vanity out of me as Rome took it out of her, and I\\nwon\\'t be a humbug any longer.  Now what shall I do?\"\\n\\nThat seemed a hard question to answer, and Laurie began to wish he had\\nto work for his daily bread.  Now if ever, occurred an eligible\\nopportunity for \\'going to the devil\\', as he once forcibly expressed it,\\nfor he had plenty of money and nothing to do, and Satan is proverbially\\nfond of providing employment for full and idle hands.  The poor fellow\\nhad temptations enough from without and from within, but he withstood\\nthem pretty well, for much as he valued liberty, he valued good faith\\nand confidence more, so his promise to his grandfather, and his desire\\nto be able to look honestly into the eyes of the women who loved him,\\nand say \"All\\'s well,\" kept him safe and steady.\\n\\nVery likely some Mrs. Grundy will observe, \"I don\\'t believe it, boys\\nwill be boys, young men must sow their wild oats, and women must not\\nexpect miracles.\"  I dare say you don\\'t, Mrs. Grundy, but it\\'s true\\nnevertheless.  Women work a good many miracles, and I have a persuasion\\nthat they may perform even that of raising the standard of manhood by\\nrefusing to echo such sayings.  Let the boys be boys, the longer the\\nbetter, and let the young men sow their wild oats if they must.  But\\nmothers, sisters, and friends may help to make the crop a small one,\\nand keep many tares from spoiling the harvest, by believing, and\\nshowing that they believe, in the possibility of loyalty to the virtues\\nwhich make men manliest in good women\\'s eyes.  If it is a feminine\\ndelusion, leave us to enjoy it while we may, for without it half the\\nbeauty and the romance of life is lost, and sorrowful forebodings would\\nembitter all our hopes of the brave, tenderhearted little lads, who\\nstill love their mothers better than themselves and are not ashamed to\\nown it.\\n\\nLaurie thought that the task of forgetting his love for Jo would absorb\\nall his powers for years, but to his great surprise he discovered it\\ngrew easier every day.  He refused to believe it at first, got angry\\nwith himself, and couldn\\'t understand it, but these hearts of ours are\\ncurious and contrary things, and time and nature work their will in\\nspite of us.  Laurie\\'s heart wouldn\\'t ache.  The wound persisted in\\nhealing with a rapidity that astonished him, and instead of trying to\\nforget, he found himself trying to remember.  He had not foreseen this\\nturn of affairs, and was not prepared for it.  He was disgusted with\\nhimself, surprised at his own fickleness, and full of a queer mixture\\nof disappointment and relief that he could recover from such a\\ntremendous blow so soon.  He carefully stirred up the embers of his\\nlost love, but they refused to burst into a blaze.  There was only a\\ncomfortable glow that warmed and did him good without putting him into\\na fever, and he was reluctantly obliged to confess that the boyish\\npassion was slowly subsiding into a more tranquil sentiment, very\\ntender, a little sad and resentful still, but that was sure to pass\\naway in time, leaving a brotherly affection which would last unbroken\\nto the end.\\n\\nAs the word \\'brotherly\\' passed through his mind in one of his reveries,\\nhe smiled, and glanced up at the picture of Mozart that was before\\nhim...\\n\\n\"Well, he was a great man, and when he couldn\\'t have one sister he took\\nthe other, and was happy.\"\\n\\nLaurie did not utter the words, but he thought them, and the next\\ninstant kissed the little old ring, saying to himself, \"No, I won\\'t!  I\\nhaven\\'t forgotten, I never can.  I\\'ll try again, and if that fails, why\\nthen...\"\\n\\nLeaving his sentence unfinished, he seized pen and paper and wrote to\\nJo, telling her that he could not settle to anything while there was\\nthe least hope of her changing her mind. Couldn\\'t she, wouldn\\'t\\nshe--and let him come home and be happy? While waiting for an answer he\\ndid nothing, but he did it energetically, for he was in a fever of\\nimpatience.  It came at last, and settled his mind effectually on one\\npoint, for Jo decidedly couldn\\'t and wouldn\\'t.  She was wrapped up in\\nBeth, and never wished to hear the word love again.  Then she begged\\nhim to be happy with somebody else, but always keep a little corner of\\nhis heart for his loving sister Jo.  In a postscript she desired him\\nnot to tell Amy that Beth was worse, she was coming home in the spring\\nand there was no need of saddening the remainder of her stay.  That\\nwould be time enough, please God, but Laurie must write to her often,\\nand not let her feel lonely, homesick or anxious.\\n\\n\"So I will, at once.  Poor little girl, it will be a sad going home for\\nher, I\\'m afraid,\" and Laurie opened his desk, as if writing to Amy had\\nbeen the proper conclusion of the sentence left unfinished some weeks\\nbefore.\\n\\nBut he did not write the letter that day, for as he rummaged out his\\nbest paper, he came across something which changed his purpose.\\nTumbling about in one part of the desk among bills, passports, and\\nbusiness documents of various kinds were several of Jo\\'s letters, and\\nin another compartment were three notes from Amy, carefully tied up\\nwith one of her blue ribbons and sweetly suggestive of the little dead\\nroses put away inside.  With a half-repentant, half-amused expression,\\nLaurie gathered up all Jo\\'s letters, smoothed, folded, and put them\\nneatly into a small drawer of the desk, stood a minute turning the ring\\nthoughtfully on his finger, then slowly drew it off, laid it with the\\nletters, locked the drawer, and went out to hear High Mass at Saint\\nStefan\\'s, feeling as if there had been a funeral, and though not\\noverwhelmed with affliction, this seemed a more proper way to spend the\\nrest of the day than in writing letters to charming young ladies.\\n\\nThe letter went very soon, however, and was promptly answered, for Amy\\nwas homesick, and confessed it in the most delightfully confiding\\nmanner.  The correspondence flourished famously, and letters flew to\\nand fro with unfailing regularity all through the early spring.  Laurie\\nsold his busts, made allumettes of his opera, and went back to Paris,\\nhoping somebody would arrive before long.  He wanted desperately to go\\nto Nice, but would not till he was asked, and Amy would not ask him,\\nfor just then she was having little experiences of her own, which made\\nher rather wish to avoid the quizzical eyes of \\'our boy\\'.\\n\\nFred Vaughn had returned, and put the question to which she had once\\ndecided to answer, \"Yes, thank you,\" but now she said, \"No, thank you,\"\\nkindly but steadily, for when the time came, her courage failed her,\\nand she found that something more than money and position was needed to\\nsatisfy the new longing that filled her heart so full of tender hopes\\nand fears.  The words, \"Fred is a good fellow, but not at all the man I\\nfancied you would ever like,\" and Laurie\\'s face when he uttered them,\\nkept returning to her as pertinaciously as her own did when she said in\\nlook, if not in words, \"I shall marry for money.\"  It troubled her to\\nremember that now, she wished she could take it back, it sounded so\\nunwomanly. She didn\\'t want Laurie to think her a heartless,  worldly\\ncreature.  She didn\\'t care to be a queen of society now half so much as\\nshe did to be a lovable woman.  She was so glad he didn\\'t hate her for\\nthe dreadful things she said, but took them so beautifully and was\\nkinder than ever.  His letters were such a comfort, for the home\\nletters were very irregular and not half so satisfactory as his when\\nthey did come.  It was not only a pleasure, but a duty to answer them,\\nfor the poor fellow was forlorn, and needed petting, since Jo persisted\\nin being stonyhearted.  She ought to have made an effort and tried to\\nlove him.  It couldn\\'t be very hard, many people would be proud and\\nglad to have such a dear boy care for them.  But Jo never would act\\nlike other girls, so there was nothing to do but be very kind and treat\\nhim like a brother.\\n\\nIf all brothers were treated as well as Laurie was at this period, they\\nwould be a much happier race of beings than they are.  Amy never\\nlectured now.  She asked his opinion on all subjects, she was\\ninterested in everything he did, made charming little presents for him,\\nand sent him two letters a week, full of lively gossip, sisterly\\nconfidences, and captivating sketches of the lovely scenes about her.\\nAs few brothers are complimented by having their letters carried about\\nin their sister\\'s pockets, read and reread diligently, cried over when\\nshort, kissed when long, and treasured carefully, we will not hint that\\nAmy did any of these fond and foolish things.  But she certainly did\\ngrow a little pale and pensive that spring, lost much of her relish for\\nsociety, and went out sketching alone a good deal.  She never had much\\nto show when she came home, but was studying nature, I dare say, while\\nshe sat for hours, with her hands folded, on the terrace at Valrosa, or\\nabsently sketched any fancy that occurred to her, a stalwart knight\\ncarved on a tomb, a young man asleep in the grass, with his hat over\\nhis eyes, or a curly haired girl in gorgeous array, promenading down a\\nballroom on the arm of a tall gentleman, both faces being left a blur\\naccording to the last fashion in art, which was safe but not altogether\\nsatisfactory.\\n\\nHer aunt thought that she regretted her answer to Fred, and finding\\ndenials useless and explanations impossible, Amy left her to think what\\nshe liked, taking care that Laurie should know that Fred had gone to\\nEgypt.  That was all, but he understood it, and looked relieved, as he\\nsaid to himself, with a venerable air...\\n\\n\"I was sure she would think better of it.  Poor old fellow! I\\'ve been\\nthrough it all, and I can sympathize.\"\\n\\nWith that he heaved a great sigh, and then, as if he had discharged his\\nduty to the past, put his feet up on the sofa and enjoyed Amy\\'s letter\\nluxuriously.\\n\\nWhile these changes were going on abroad, trouble had come at home.\\nBut the letter telling that Beth was failing never reached Amy, and\\nwhen the next found her at Vevay, for the heat had driven them from\\nNice in May, and they had travelled slowly to Switzerland, by way of\\nGenoa and the Italian lakes.  She bore it very well, and quietly\\nsubmitted to the family decree that she should not shorten her visit,\\nfor since it was too late to say goodbye to Beth, she had better stay,\\nand let absence soften her sorrow.  But her heart was very heavy, she\\nlonged to be at home, and every day looked wistfully across the lake,\\nwaiting for Laurie to come and comfort her.\\n\\nHe did come very soon, for the same mail brought letters to them both,\\nbut he was in Germany, and it took some days to reach him.  The moment\\nhe read it, he packed his knapsack, bade adieu to his fellow\\npedestrians, and was off to keep his promise, with a heart full of joy\\nand sorrow, hope and suspense.\\n\\nHe knew Vevay well, and as soon as the boat touched the little quay, he\\nhurried along the shore to La Tour, where the Carrols were living en\\npension.  The garcon was in despair that the whole family had gone to\\ntake a promenade on the lake, but no, the blonde mademoiselle might be\\nin the chateau garden.  If monsieur would give himself the pain of\\nsitting down, a flash of time should present her.  But monsieur could\\nnot wait even a \\'flash of time\\', and in the middle of the speech\\ndeparted to find mademoiselle himself.\\n\\nA pleasant old garden on the borders of the lovely lake, with chestnuts\\nrustling overhead, ivy climbing everywhere, and the black shadow of the\\ntower falling far across the sunny water.  At one corner of the wide,\\nlow wall was a seat, and here Amy often came to read or work, or\\nconsole herself with the beauty all about her.  She was sitting here\\nthat day, leaning her head on her hand, with a homesick heart and heavy\\neyes, thinking of Beth and wondering why Laurie did not come.  She did\\nnot hear him cross the courtyard beyond, nor see him pause in the\\narchway that led from the subterranean path into the garden.  He stood\\na minute looking at her with new eyes, seeing what no one had ever seen\\nbefore, the tender side of Amy\\'s character. Everything about her mutely\\nsuggested love and sorrow, the blotted letters in her lap, the black\\nribbon that tied up her hair, the womanly pain and patience in her\\nface, even the little ebony cross at her throat seemed pathetic to\\nLaurie, for he had given it to her, and she wore it as her only\\nornament. If he had any doubts about the reception she would give him,\\nthey were set at rest the minute she looked up and saw him, for\\ndropping everything, she ran to him, exclaiming in a tone of\\nunmistakable love and longing...\\n\\n\"Oh, Laurie, Laurie, I knew you\\'d come to me!\"\\n\\nI think everything was said and settled then, for as they stood\\ntogether quite silent for a moment, with the dark head bent down\\nprotectingly over the light one, Amy felt that no one could comfort and\\nsustain her so well as Laurie, and Laurie decided that Amy was the only\\nwoman in the world who could fill Jo\\'s place and make him happy.  He\\ndid not tell her so, but she was not disappointed, for both felt the\\ntruth, were satisfied, and gladly left the rest to silence.\\n\\nIn a minute Amy went back to her place, and while she dried her tears,\\nLaurie gathered up the scattered papers, finding in the sight of sundry\\nwell-worn letters and suggestive sketches good omens for the future.\\nAs he sat down beside her, Amy felt shy again, and turned rosy red at\\nthe recollection of her impulsive greeting.\\n\\n\"I couldn\\'t help it, I felt so lonely and sad, and was so very glad to\\nsee you.  It was such a surprise to look up and find you, just as I was\\nbeginning to fear you wouldn\\'t come,\" she said, trying in vain to speak\\nquite naturally.\\n\\n\"I came the minute I heard.  I wish I could say something to comfort\\nyou for the loss of dear little Beth, but I can only feel, and...\"  He\\ncould not get any further, for he too turned bashful all of a sudden,\\nand did not quite know what to say.  He longed to lay Amy\\'s head down\\non his shoulder, and tell her to have a good cry, but he did not dare,\\nso took her hand instead, and gave it a sympathetic squeeze that was\\nbetter than words.\\n\\n\"You needn\\'t say anything, this comforts me,\" she said softly.  \"Beth\\nis well and happy, and I mustn\\'t wish her back, but I dread the going\\nhome, much as I long to see them all. We won\\'t talk about it now, for\\nit makes me cry, and I want to enjoy you while you stay.  You needn\\'t\\ngo right back, need you?\"\\n\\n\"Not if you want me, dear.\"\\n\\n\"I do, so much.  Aunt and Flo are very kind, but you seem like one of\\nthe family, and it would be so comfortable to have you for a little\\nwhile.\"\\n\\nAmy spoke and looked so like a homesick child whose heart was full that\\nLaurie forgot his bashfulness all at once, and gave her just what she\\nwanted--the petting she was used to and the cheerful conversation she\\nneeded.\\n\\n\"Poor little soul, you look as if you\\'d grieved yourself half sick!\\nI\\'m going to take care of you, so don\\'t cry any more, but come and walk\\nabout with me, the wind is too chilly for you to sit still,\" he said,\\nin the half-caressing, half-commanding way that Amy liked, as he tied\\non her hat, drew her arm through his, and began to pace up and down the\\nsunny walk under the new-leaved chestnuts.  He felt more at ease upon\\nhis legs, and Amy found it pleasant to have a strong arm to lean upon,\\na familiar face to smile at her, and a kind voice to talk delightfully\\nfor her alone.\\n\\nThe quaint old garden had sheltered many pairs of lovers, and seemed\\nexpressly made for them, so sunny and secluded was it, with nothing but\\nthe tower to overlook them, and the wide lake to carry away the echo of\\ntheir words, as it rippled by below.  For an hour this new pair walked\\nand talked, or rested on the wall, enjoying the sweet influences which\\ngave such a charm to time and place, and when an unromantic dinner bell\\nwarned them away, Amy felt as if she left her burden of loneliness and\\nsorrow behind her in the chateau garden.\\n\\nThe moment Mrs. Carrol saw the girl\\'s altered face, she was illuminated\\nwith a new idea, and exclaimed to herself, \"Now I understand it\\nall--the child has been pining for young Laurence.  Bless my heart, I\\nnever thought of such a thing!\"\\n\\nWith praiseworthy discretion, the good lady said nothing, and betrayed\\nno sign of enlightenment, but cordially urged Laurie to stay and begged\\nAmy to enjoy his society, for it would do her more good than so much\\nsolitude.  Amy was a model of docility, and as her aunt was a good deal\\noccupied with Flo, she was left to entertain her friend, and did it\\nwith more than her usual success.\\n\\nAt Nice, Laurie had lounged and Amy had scolded.  At Vevay, Laurie was\\nnever idle, but always walking, riding, boating, or studying in the\\nmost energetic manner, while Amy admired everything he did and followed\\nhis example as far and as fast as she could.  He said the change was\\nowing to the climate, and she did not contradict him, being glad of a\\nlike excuse for her own recovered health and spirits.\\n\\nThe invigorating air did them both good, and much exercise worked\\nwholesome changes in minds as well as bodies. They seemed to get\\nclearer views of life and duty up there among the everlasting hills.\\nThe fresh winds blew away desponding doubts, delusive fancies, and\\nmoody mists.  The warm spring sunshine brought out all sorts of\\naspiring ideas, tender hopes, and happy thoughts.  The lake seemed to\\nwash away the troubles of the past, and the grand old mountains to look\\nbenignly down upon them saying, \"Little children, love one another.\"\\n\\nIn spite of the new sorrow, it was a very happy time, so happy that\\nLaurie could not bear to disturb it by a word.  It took him a little\\nwhile to recover from his surprise at the cure of his first, and as he\\nhad firmly believed, his last and only love.  He consoled himself for\\nthe seeming disloyalty by the thought that Jo\\'s sister was almost the\\nsame as Jo\\'s self, and the conviction that it would have been\\nimpossible to love any other woman but Amy so soon and so well.  His\\nfirst wooing had been of the tempestuous order, and he looked back upon\\nit as if through a long vista of years with a feeling of compassion\\nblended with regret.  He was not ashamed of it, but put it away as one\\nof the bitter-sweet experiences of his life, for which he could be\\ngrateful when the pain was over. His second wooing, he resolved, should\\nbe as calm and simple as possible.  There was no need of having a\\nscene, hardly any need of telling Amy that he loved her, she knew it\\nwithout words and had given him his answer long ago.  It all came about\\nso naturally that no one could complain, and he knew that everybody\\nwould be pleased, even Jo.  But when our first little passion has been\\ncrushed, we are apt to be wary and slow in making a second trial, so\\nLaurie let the days pass, enjoying every hour, and leaving to chance\\nthe utterance of the word that would put an end to the first and\\nsweetest part of his new romance.\\n\\nHe had rather imagined that the denoument would take place in the\\nchateau garden by moonlight, and in the most graceful and decorous\\nmanner, but it turned out exactly the reverse, for the matter was\\nsettled on the lake at noonday in a few blunt words. They had been\\nfloating about all the morning, from gloomy St.  Gingolf to sunny\\nMontreux, with the Alps of Savoy on one side, Mont St.  Bernard and the\\nDent du Midi on the other, pretty Vevay in the valley, and Lausanne\\nupon the hill beyond, a cloudless blue sky overhead, and the bluer lake\\nbelow, dotted with the picturesque boats that look like white-winged\\ngulls.\\n\\nThey had been talking of Bonnivard, as they glided past Chillon, and of\\nRousseau, as they looked up at Clarens, where he wrote his Heloise.\\nNeither had read it, but they knew it was a love story, and each\\nprivately wondered if it was half as interesting as their own.  Amy had\\nbeen dabbling her hand in the water during the little pause that fell\\nbetween them, and when she looked up, Laurie was leaning on his oars\\nwith an expression in his eyes that made her say hastily, merely for\\nthe sake of saying something...\\n\\n\"You must be tired.  Rest a little, and let me row.  It will do me\\ngood, for since you came I have been altogether lazy and luxurious.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not tired, but you may take an oar, if you like.  There\\'s room\\nenough, though I have to sit nearly in the middle, else the boat won\\'t\\ntrim,\" returned Laurie, as if he rather liked the arrangement.\\n\\nFeeling that she had not mended matters much, Amy took the offered\\nthird of a seat, shook her hair over her face, and accepted an oar.\\nShe rowed as well as she did many other things, and though she used\\nboth hands, and Laurie but one, the oars kept time, and the boat went\\nsmoothly through the water.\\n\\n\"How well we pull together, don\\'t we?\" said Amy, who objected to\\nsilence just then.\\n\\n\"So well that I wish we might always pull in the same boat. Will you,\\nAmy?\" very tenderly.\\n\\n\"Yes, Laurie,\" very low.\\n\\nThen they both stopped rowing, and unconsciously added a pretty little\\ntableau of human love and happiness to the dissolving views reflected\\nin the lake.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'FORTY-TWO\\n\\nALL ALONE\\n\\nIt was easy to promise self-abnegation when self was wrapped up in\\nanother, and heart and soul were purified by a sweet example.  But when\\nthe helpful voice was silent, the daily lesson over, the beloved\\npresence gone, and nothing remained but loneliness and grief, then Jo\\nfound her promise very hard to keep.  How could she \\'comfort Father and\\nMother\\' when her own heart ached with a ceaseless longing for her\\nsister, how could she \\'make the house cheerful\\' when all its light and\\nwarmth and beauty seemed to have deserted it when Beth left the old\\nhome for the new, and where in all the world could she \\'find some\\nuseful, happy work to do\\', that would take the place of the loving\\nservice which had been its own reward?  She tried in a blind, hopeless\\nway to do her duty, secretly rebelling against it all the while, for it\\nseemed unjust that her few joys should be lessened, her burdens made\\nheavier, and life get harder and harder as she toiled along.  Some\\npeople seemed to get all sunshine, and some all shadow.  It was not\\nfair, for she tried more than Amy to be good, but never got any reward,\\nonly disappointment, trouble and hard work.\\n\\nPoor Jo, these were dark days to her, for something like despair came\\nover her when she thought of spending all her life in that quiet house,\\ndevoted to humdrum cares, a few small pleasures, and the duty that\\nnever seemed to grow any easier.  \"I can\\'t do it. I wasn\\'t meant for a\\nlife like this, and I know I shall break away and do something\\ndesperate if somebody doesn\\'t come and help me,\" she said to herself,\\nwhen her first efforts failed and she fell into the moody, miserable\\nstate of mind which often comes when strong wills have to yield to the\\ninevitable.\\n\\nBut someone did come and help her, though Jo did not recognize her good\\nangels at once because they wore familiar shapes and used the simple\\nspells best fitted to poor humanity.  Often she started up at night,\\nthinking Beth called her, and when the sight of the little empty bed\\nmade her cry with the bitter cry of unsubmissive sorrow, \"Oh, Beth,\\ncome back!  Come back!\" she did not stretch out her yearning arms in\\nvain.  For, as quick to hear her sobbing as she had been to hear her\\nsister\\'s faintest whisper, her mother came to comfort her, not with\\nwords only, but the patient tenderness that soothes by a touch, tears\\nthat were mute reminders of a greater grief than Jo\\'s, and broken\\nwhispers, more eloquent than prayers, because hopeful resignation went\\nhand-in-hand with natural sorrow. Sacred moments, when heart talked to\\nheart in the silence of the night, turning affliction to a blessing,\\nwhich chastened grief and strengthened love.  Feeling this, Jo\\'s burden\\nseemed easier to bear, duty grew sweeter, and life looked more\\nendurable, seen from the safe shelter of her mother\\'s arms.\\n\\nWhen aching heart was a little comforted, troubled mind likewise found\\nhelp, for one day she went to the study, and leaning over the good gray\\nhead lifted to welcome her with a tranquil smile, she said very humbly,\\n\"Father, talk to me as you did to Beth.  I need it more than she did,\\nfor I\\'m all wrong.\"\\n\\n\"My dear, nothing can comfort me like this,\" he answered, with a falter\\nin his voice, and both arms round her, as if he too, needed help, and\\ndid not fear to ask for it.\\n\\nThen, sitting in Beth\\'s little chair close beside him, Jo told her\\ntroubles, the resentful sorrow for her loss, the fruitless efforts that\\ndiscouraged her, the want of faith that made life look so dark, and all\\nthe sad bewilderment which we call despair.  She gave him entire\\nconfidence, he gave her the help she needed, and both found consolation\\nin the act.  For the time had come when they could talk together not\\nonly as father and daughter, but as man and woman, able and glad to\\nserve each other with mutual sympathy as well as mutual love.  Happy,\\nthoughtful times there in the old study which Jo called \\'the church of\\none member\\', and from which she came with fresh courage, recovered\\ncheerfulness, and a more submissive spirit. For the parents who had\\ntaught one child to meet death without fear, were trying now to teach\\nanother to accept life without despondency or distrust, and to use its\\nbeautiful opportunities with gratitude and power.\\n\\nOther helps had Jo--humble, wholesome duties and delights that would\\nnot be denied their part in serving her, and which she slowly learned\\nto see and value.  Brooms and dishcloths never could be as distasteful\\nas they once had been, for Beth had presided over both, and something\\nof her housewifely spirit seemed to linger around the little mop and\\nthe old brush, never thrown away.  As she used them, Jo found herself\\nhumming the songs Beth used to hum, imitating Beth\\'s orderly ways, and\\ngiving the little touches here and there that kept everything fresh and\\ncozy, which was the first step toward making home happy, though she\\ndidn\\'t know it till Hannah said with an approving squeeze of the hand...\\n\\n\"You thoughtful creeter, you\\'re determined we shan\\'t miss that dear\\nlamb ef you can help it.  We don\\'t say much, but we see it, and the\\nLord will bless you for\\'t, see ef He don\\'t.\"\\n\\nAs they sat sewing together, Jo discovered how much improved her sister\\nMeg was, how well she could talk, how much she knew about good, womanly\\nimpulses, thoughts, and feelings, how happy she was in husband and\\nchildren, and how much they were all doing for each other.\\n\\n\"Marriage is an excellent thing, after all.  I wonder if I should\\nblossom out half as well as you have, if I tried it?, always\\n_\\'perwisin\\'_ I could,\" said Jo, as she constructed a kite for Demi in\\nthe topsy-turvy nursery.\\n\\n\"It\\'s just what you need to bring out the tender womanly half of your\\nnature, Jo.  You are like a chestnut burr, prickly outside, but\\nsilky-soft within, and a sweet kernal, if one can only get at it.  Love\\nwill make you show your heart one day, and then the rough burr will\\nfall off.\"\\n\\n\"Frost opens chestnut burrs, ma\\'am, and it takes a good shake to bring\\nthem down.  Boys go nutting, and I don\\'t care to be bagged by them,\"\\nreturned Jo, pasting away at the kite which no wind that blows would\\never carry up, for Daisy had tied herself on as a bob.\\n\\nMeg laughed, for she was glad to see a glimmer of Jo\\'s old spirit, but\\nshe felt it her duty to enforce her opinion by every argument in her\\npower, and the sisterly chats were not wasted, especially as two of\\nMeg\\'s most effective arguments were the babies, whom Jo loved tenderly.\\nGrief is the best opener of some hearts, and Jo\\'s was nearly ready for\\nthe bag.  A little more sunshine to ripen the nut, then, not a boy\\'s\\nimpatient shake, but a man\\'s hand reached up to pick it gently from the\\nburr, and find the kernal sound and sweet. If she suspected this, she\\nwould have shut up tight, and been more prickly than ever, fortunately\\nshe wasn\\'t thinking about herself, so when the time came, down she\\ndropped.\\n\\nNow, if she had been the heroine of a moral storybook, she ought at\\nthis period of her life to have become quite saintly, renounced the\\nworld, and gone about doing good in a mortified bonnet, with tracts in\\nher pocket.  But, you see, Jo wasn\\'t a heroine, she was only a\\nstruggling human girl like hundreds of others, and she just acted out\\nher nature, being sad, cross, listless, or energetic, as the mood\\nsuggested.  It\\'s highly virtuous to say we\\'ll be good, but we can\\'t do\\nit all at once, and it takes a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all\\ntogether before some of us even get our feet set in the right way.  Jo\\nhad got so far, she was learning to do her duty, and to feel unhappy if\\nshe did not, but to do it cheerfully, ah, that was another thing!  She\\nhad often said she wanted to do something splendid, no matter how hard,\\nand now she had her wish, for what could be more beautiful than to\\ndevote her life to Father and Mother, trying to make home as happy to\\nthem as they had to her?  And if difficulties were necessary to\\nincrease the splendor of the effort, what could be harder for a\\nrestless, ambitious girl than to give up her own hopes, plans, and\\ndesires, and cheerfully live for others?\\n\\nProvidence had taken her at her word.  Here was the task, not what she\\nhad expected, but better because self had no part in it. Now, could she\\ndo it?  She decided that she would try, and in her first attempt she\\nfound the helps I have suggested.  Still another was given her, and she\\ntook it, not as a reward, but as a comfort, as Christian took the\\nrefreshment afforded by the little arbor where he rested, as he climbed\\nthe hill called Difficulty.\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you write?  That always used to make you happy,\" said her\\nmother once, when the desponding fit over-shadowed Jo.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve no heart to write, and if I had, nobody cares for my things.\"\\n\\n\"We do.  Write something for us, and never mind the rest of the world.\\nTry it, dear.  I\\'m sure it would do you good, and please us very much.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t believe I can.\"  But Jo got out her desk and began to overhaul\\nher half-finished manuscripts.\\n\\nAn hour afterward her mother peeped in and there she was, scratching\\naway, with her black pinafore on, and an absorbed expression, which\\ncaused Mrs. March to smile and slip away, well pleased with the success\\nof her suggestion.  Jo never knew how it happened, but something got\\ninto that story that went straight to the hearts of those who read it,\\nfor when her family had laughed and cried over it, her father sent it,\\nmuch against her will, to one of the popular magazines, and to her\\nutter surprise, it was not only paid for, but others requested.\\nLetters from several persons, whose praise was honor, followed the\\nappearance of the little story, newspapers copied it, and strangers as\\nwell as friends admired it.  For a small thing it was a great success,\\nand Jo was more astonished than when her novel was commended and\\ncondemned all at once.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t understand it.  What can there be in a simple little story\\nlike that to make people praise it so?\" she said, quite bewildered.\\n\\n\"There is truth in it, Jo, that\\'s the secret.  Humor and pathos make it\\nalive, and you have found your style at last.  You wrote with no\\nthoughts of fame and money, and put your heart into it, my daughter.\\nYou have had the bitter, now comes the sweet.  Do your best, and grow\\nas happy as we are in your success.\"\\n\\n\"If there is anything good or true in what I write, it isn\\'t mine.  I\\nowe it all to you and Mother and Beth,\" said Jo, more touched by her\\nfather\\'s words than by any amount of praise from the world.\\n\\nSo taught by love and sorrow, Jo wrote her little stories, and sent\\nthem away to make friends for themselves and her, finding it a very\\ncharitable world to such humble wanderers, for they were kindly\\nwelcomed, and sent home comfortable tokens to their mother, like\\ndutiful children whom good fortune overtakes.\\n\\nWhen Amy and Laurie wrote of their engagement, Mrs. March feared that\\nJo would find it difficult to rejoice over it, but her fears were soon\\nset at rest, for though Jo looked grave at first, she took it very\\nquietly, and was full of hopes and plans for \\'the children\\' before she\\nread the letter twice.  It was a sort of written duet, wherein each\\nglorified the other in loverlike fashion, very pleasant to read and\\nsatisfactory to think of, for no one had any objection to make.\\n\\n\"You like it, Mother?\" said Jo, as they laid down the closely written\\nsheets and looked at one another.\\n\\n\"Yes, I hoped it would be so, ever since Amy wrote that she had refused\\nFred.  I felt sure then that something better than what you call the\\n\\'mercenary spirit\\' had come over her, and a hint here and there in her\\nletters made me suspect that love and Laurie would win the day.\"\\n\\n\"How sharp you are, Marmee, and how silent!  You never said a word to\\nme.\"\\n\\n\"Mothers have need of sharp eyes and discreet tongues when they have\\ngirls to manage.  I was half afraid to put the idea into your head,\\nlest you should write and congratulate them before the thing was\\nsettled.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not the scatterbrain I was.  You may trust me.  I\\'m sober and\\nsensible enough for anyone\\'s confidante now.\"\\n\\n\"So you are, my dear, and I should have made you mine, only I fancied\\nit might pain you to learn that your Teddy loved someone else.\"\\n\\n\"Now, Mother, did you really think I could be so silly and selfish,\\nafter I\\'d refused his love, when it was freshest, if not best?\"\\n\\n\"I knew you were sincere then, Jo, but lately I have thought that if he\\ncame back, and asked again, you might perhaps, feel like giving another\\nanswer.  Forgive me, dear, I can\\'t help seeing that you are very\\nlonely, and sometimes there is a hungry look in your eyes that goes to\\nmy heart.  So I fancied that your boy might fill the empty place if he\\ntried now.\"\\n\\n\"No, Mother, it is better as it is, and I\\'m glad Amy has learned to\\nlove him.  But you are right in one thing.  I am lonely, and perhaps if\\nTeddy had tried again, I might have said \\'Yes\\', not because I love him\\nany more, but because I care more to be loved than when he went away.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad of that, Jo, for it shows that you are getting on. There are\\nplenty to love you, so try to be satisfied with Father and Mother,\\nsisters and brothers, friends and babies, till the best lover of all\\ncomes to give you your reward.\"\\n\\n\"Mothers are the best lovers in the world, but I don\\'t mind whispering\\nto Marmee that I\\'d like to try all kinds.  It\\'s very curious, but the\\nmore I try to satisfy myself with all sorts of natural affections, the\\nmore I seem to want.  I\\'d no idea hearts could take in so many.  Mine\\nis so elastic, it never seems full now, and I used to be quite\\ncontented with my family.  I don\\'t understand it.\"\\n\\n\"I do,\" and Mrs. March smiled her wise smile, as Jo turned back the\\nleaves to read what Amy said of Laurie.\\n\\n\"It is so beautiful to be loved as Laurie loves me.  He isn\\'t\\nsentimental, doesn\\'t say much about it, but I see and feel it in all he\\nsays and does, and it makes me so happy and so humble that I don\\'t seem\\nto be the same girl I was.  I never knew how good and generous and\\ntender he was till now, for he lets me read his heart, and I find it\\nfull of noble impulses and hopes and purposes, and am so proud to know\\nit\\'s mine.  He says he feels as if he \\'could make a prosperous voyage\\nnow with me aboard as mate, and lots of love for ballast\\'.  I pray he\\nmay, and try to be all he believes me, for I love my gallant captain\\nwith all my heart and soul and might, and never will desert him, while\\nGod lets us be together. Oh, Mother, I never knew how much like heaven\\nthis world could be, when two people love and live for one another!\"\\n\\n\"And that\\'s our cool, reserved, and worldly Amy!  Truly, love does work\\nmiracles.  How very, very happy they must be!\" and Jo laid the rustling\\nsheets together with a careful hand, as one might shut the covers of a\\nlovely romance, which holds the reader fast till the end comes, and he\\nfinds himself alone in the workaday world again.\\n\\nBy-and-by Jo roamed away upstairs, for it was rainy, and she could not\\nwalk.  A restless spirit possessed her, and the old feeling came again,\\nnot bitter as it once was, but a sorrowfully patient wonder why one\\nsister should have all she asked, the other nothing.  It was not true,\\nshe knew that and tried to put it away, but the natural craving for\\naffection was strong, and Amy\\'s happiness woke the hungry longing for\\nsomeone to \\'love with heart and soul, and cling to while God let them\\nbe together\\'. Up in the garret, where Jo\\'s unquiet wanderings ended\\nstood four little wooden chests in a row, each marked with its owners\\nname, and each filled with relics of the childhood and girlhood ended\\nnow for all.  Jo glanced into them, and when she came to her own,\\nleaned her chin on the edge, and stared absently at the chaotic\\ncollection, till a bundle of old exercise books caught her eye.  She\\ndrew them out, turned them over, and relived that pleasant winter at\\nkind Mrs. Kirke\\'s.  She had smiled at first, then she looked\\nthoughtful, next sad, and when she came to a little message written in\\nthe Professor\\'s hand, her lips began to tremble, the books slid out of\\nher lap, and she sat looking at the friendly words, as they took a new\\nmeaning, and touched a tender spot in her heart.\\n\\n\"Wait for me, my friend.  I may be a little late, but I shall surely\\ncome.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, if he only would!  So kind, so good, so patient with me always, my\\ndear old Fritz.  I didn\\'t value him half enough when I had him, but now\\nhow I should love to see him, for everyone seems going away from me,\\nand I\\'m all alone.\"\\n\\nAnd holding the little paper fast, as if it were a promise yet to be\\nfulfilled, Jo laid her head down on a comfortable rag bag, and cried,\\nas if in opposition to the rain pattering on the roof.\\n\\nWas it all self-pity, loneliness, or low spirits?  Or was it the waking\\nup of a sentiment which had bided its time as patiently as its\\ninspirer?  Who shall say?\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'FORTY-THREE\\n\\nSURPRISES\\n\\nJo was alone in the twilight, lying on the old sofa, looking at the\\nfire, and thinking.  It was her favorite way of spending the hour of\\ndusk.  No one disturbed her, and she used to lie there on Beth\\'s little\\nred pillow, planning stories, dreaming dreams, or thinking tender\\nthoughts of the sister who never seemed far away.  Her face looked\\ntired, grave, and rather sad, for tomorrow was her birthday, and she\\nwas thinking how fast the years went by, how old she was getting, and\\nhow little she seemed to have accomplished.  Almost twenty-five, and\\nnothing to show for it.  Jo was mistaken in that.  There was a good\\ndeal to show, and by-and-by she saw, and was grateful for it.\\n\\n\"An old maid, that\\'s what I\\'m to be.  A literary spinster, with a pen\\nfor a spouse, a family of stories for children, and twenty years hence\\na morsel of fame, perhaps, when, like poor Johnson, I\\'m old and can\\'t\\nenjoy it, solitary, and can\\'t share it, independent, and don\\'t need it.\\nWell, I needn\\'t be a sour saint nor a selfish sinner, and, I dare say,\\nold maids are very comfortable when they get used to it, but...\" and\\nthere Jo sighed, as if the prospect was not inviting.\\n\\nIt seldom is, at first, and thirty seems the end of all things to\\nfive-and-twenty.  But it\\'s not as bad as it looks, and one can get on\\nquite happily if one has something in one\\'s self to fall back upon.  At\\ntwenty-five, girls begin to talk about being old maids, but secretly\\nresolve that they never will be.  At thirty they say nothing about it,\\nbut quietly accept the fact, and if sensible, console themselves by\\nremembering that they have twenty more useful, happy years, in which\\nthey may be learning to grow old gracefully.  Don\\'t laugh at the\\nspinsters, dear girls, for often very tender, tragic romances are\\nhidden away in the hearts that beat so quietly under the sober gowns,\\nand many silent sacrifices of youth, health, ambition, love itself,\\nmake the faded faces beautiful in God\\'s sight.  Even the sad, sour\\nsisters should be kindly dealt with, because they have missed the\\nsweetest part of life, if for no other reason.  And looking at them\\nwith compassion, not contempt, girls in their bloom should remember\\nthat they too may miss the blossom time.  That rosy cheeks don\\'t last\\nforever, that silver threads will come in the bonnie brown hair, and\\nthat, by-and-by, kindness and respect will be as sweet as love and\\nadmiration now.\\n\\nGentlemen, which means boys, be courteous to the old maids, no matter\\nhow poor and plain and prim, for the only chivalry worth having is that\\nwhich is the readiest to pay deference to the old, protect the feeble,\\nand serve womankind, regardless of rank, age, or color.  Just recollect\\nthe good aunts who have not only lectured and fussed, but nursed and\\npetted, too often without thanks, the scrapes they have helped you out\\nof, the tips they have given you from their small store, the stitches\\nthe patient old fingers have set for you, the steps the willing old\\nfeet have taken, and gratefully pay the dear old ladies the little\\nattentions that women love to receive as long as they live.  The\\nbright-eyed girls are quick to see such traits, and will like you all\\nthe better for them, and if death, almost the only power that can part\\nmother and son, should rob you of yours, you will be sure to find a\\ntender welcome and maternal cherishing from some Aunt Priscilla, who\\nhas kept the warmest corner of her lonely old heart for \\'the best nevvy\\nin the world\\'.\\n\\nJo must have fallen asleep (as I dare say my reader has during this\\nlittle homily), for suddenly Laurie\\'s ghost seemed to stand before her,\\na substantial, lifelike ghost, leaning over her with the very look he\\nused to wear when he felt a good deal and didn\\'t like to show it.  But,\\nlike Jenny in the ballad...\\n\\n  \"She could not think it he,\"\\n\\nand lay staring up at him in startled silence, till he stooped and\\nkissed her.  Then she knew him, and flew up, crying joyfully...\\n\\n\"Oh my Teddy!  Oh my Teddy!\"\\n\\n\"Dear Jo, you are glad to see me, then?\"\\n\\n\"Glad!  My blessed boy, words can\\'t express my gladness. Where\\'s Amy?\"\\n\\n\"Your mother has got her down at Meg\\'s.  We stopped there by the way,\\nand there was no getting my wife out of their clutches.\"\\n\\n\"Your what?\" cried Jo, for Laurie uttered those two words with an\\nunconscious pride and satisfaction which betrayed him.\\n\\n\"Oh, the dickens!  Now I\\'ve done it,\" and he looked so guilty that Jo\\nwas down on him like a flash.\\n\\n\"You\\'ve gone and got married!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, please, but I never will again,\" and he went down upon his knees,\\nwith a penitent clasping of hands, and a face full of mischief, mirth,\\nand triumph.\\n\\n\"Actually married?\"\\n\\n\"Very much so, thank you.\"\\n\\n\"Mercy on us.  What dreadful thing will you do next?\" and Jo fell into\\nher seat with a gasp.\\n\\n\"A characteristic, but not exactly complimentary, congratulation,\"\\nreturned Laurie, still in an abject attitude, but beaming with\\nsatisfaction.\\n\\n\"What can you expect, when you take one\\'s breath away, creeping in like\\na burglar, and letting cats out of bags like that? Get up, you\\nridiculous boy, and tell me all about it.\"\\n\\n\"Not a word, unless you let me come in my old place, and promise not to\\nbarricade.\"\\n\\nJo laughed at that as she had not done for many a long day, and patted\\nthe sofa invitingly, as she said in a cordial tone, \"The old pillow is\\nup garret, and we don\\'t need it now.  So, come and \\'fess, Teddy.\"\\n\\n\"How good it sounds to hear you say \\'Teddy\\'! No one ever calls me that\\nbut you,\" and Laurie sat down with an air of great content.\\n\\n\"What does Amy call you?\"\\n\\n\"My lord.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s like her.  Well, you look it,\" and Jo\\'s eye plainly betrayed\\nthat she found her boy comelier than ever.\\n\\nThe pillow was gone, but there was a barricade, nevertheless, a natural\\none, raised by time, absence, and change of heart.  Both felt it, and\\nfor a minute looked at one another as if that invisible barrier cast a\\nlittle shadow over them.  It was gone directly however, for Laurie\\nsaid, with a vain attempt at dignity...\\n\\n\"Don\\'t I look like a married man and the head of a family?\"\\n\\n\"Not a bit, and you never will.  You\\'ve grown bigger and bonnier, but\\nyou are the same scapegrace as ever.\"\\n\\n\"Now really, Jo, you ought to treat me with more respect,\" began\\nLaurie, who enjoyed it all immensely.\\n\\n\"How can I, when the mere idea of you, married and settled, is so\\nirresistibly funny that I can\\'t keep sober!\" answered Jo, smiling all\\nover her face, so infectiously that they had another laugh, and then\\nsettled down for a good talk, quite in the pleasant old fashion.\\n\\n\"It\\'s no use your going out in the cold to get Amy, for they are all\\ncoming up presently.  I couldn\\'t wait.  I wanted to be the one to tell\\nyou the grand surprise, and have \\'first skim\\' as we used to say when we\\nsquabbled about the cream.\"\\n\\n\"Of course you did, and spoiled your story by beginning at the wrong\\nend.  Now, start right, and tell me how it all happened. I\\'m pining to\\nknow.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I did it to please Amy,\" began Laurie, with a twinkle that made\\nJo exclaim...\\n\\n\"Fib number one.  Amy did it to please you.  Go on, and tell the truth,\\nif you can, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Now she\\'s beginning to marm it.  Isn\\'t it jolly to hear her?\" said\\nLaurie to the fire, and the fire glowed and sparkled as if it quite\\nagreed.  \"It\\'s all the same, you know, she and I being one. We planned\\nto come home with the Carrols, a month or more ago, but they suddenly\\nchanged their minds, and decided to pass another winter in Paris.  But\\nGrandpa wanted to come home.  He went to please me, and I couldn\\'t let\\nhim go alone, neither could I leave Amy, and Mrs. Carrol had got\\nEnglish notions about chaperons and such nonsense, and wouldn\\'t let Amy\\ncome with us.  So I just settled the difficulty by saying, \\'Let\\'s be\\nmarried, and then we can do as we like\\'.\"\\n\\n\"Of course you did.  You always have things to suit you.\"\\n\\n\"Not always,\" and something in Laurie\\'s voice made Jo say hastily...\\n\\n\"How did you ever get Aunt to agree?\"\\n\\n\"It was hard work, but between us, we talked her over, for we had heaps\\nof good reasons on our side.  There wasn\\'t time to write and ask leave,\\nbut you all liked it, had consented to it by-and-by, and it was only\\n\\'taking time by the fetlock\\', as my wife says.\"\\n\\n\"Aren\\'t we proud of those two words, and don\\'t we like to say them?\"\\ninterrupted Jo, addressing the fire in her turn, and watching with\\ndelight the happy light it seemed to kindle in the eyes that had been\\nso tragically gloomy when she saw them last.\\n\\n\"A trifle, perhaps, she\\'s such a captivating little woman I can\\'t help\\nbeing proud of her.  Well, then Uncle and Aunt were there to play\\npropriety.  We were so absorbed in one another we were of no mortal use\\napart, and that charming arrangement would make everything easy all\\nround, so we did it.\"\\n\\n\"When, where, how?\" asked Jo, in a fever of feminine interest and\\ncuriosity, for she could not realize it a particle.\\n\\n\"Six weeks ago, at the American consul\\'s, in Paris, a very quiet\\nwedding of course, for even in our happiness we didn\\'t forget dear\\nlittle Beth.\"\\n\\nJo put her hand in his as he said that, and Laurie gently smoothed the\\nlittle red pillow, which he remembered well.\\n\\n\"Why didn\\'t you let us know afterward?\" asked Jo, in a quieter tone,\\nwhen they had sat quite still a minute.\\n\\n\"We wanted to surprise you.  We thought we were coming directly home,\\nat first, but the dear old gentleman, as soon as we were married, found\\nhe couldn\\'t be ready under a month, at least, and sent us off to spend\\nour honeymoon wherever we liked. Amy had once called Valrosa a regular\\nhoneymoon home, so we went there, and were as happy as people are but\\nonce in their lives. My faith!  Wasn\\'t it love among the roses!\"\\n\\nLaurie seemed to forget Jo for a minute, and Jo was glad of it, for the\\nfact that he told her these things so freely and so naturally assured\\nher that he had quite forgiven and forgotten. She tried to draw away\\nher hand, but as if he guessed the thought that prompted the\\nhalf-involuntary impulse, Laurie held it fast, and said, with a manly\\ngravity she had never seen in him before...\\n\\n\"Jo, dear, I want to say one thing, and then we\\'ll put it by forever.\\nAs I told you in my letter when I wrote that Amy had been so kind to\\nme, I never shall stop loving you, but the love is altered, and I have\\nlearned to see that it is better as it is. Amy and you changed places\\nin my heart, that\\'s all.  I think it was meant to be so, and would have\\ncome about naturally, if I had waited, as you tried to make me, but I\\nnever could be patient, and so I got a heartache.  I was a boy then,\\nheadstrong and violent, and it took a hard lesson to show me my\\nmistake.  For it was one, Jo, as you said, and I found it out, after\\nmaking a fool of myself. Upon my word, I was so tumbled up in my mind,\\nat one time, that I didn\\'t know which I loved best, you or Amy, and\\ntried to love you both alike.  But I couldn\\'t, and when I saw her in\\nSwitzerland, everything seemed to clear up all at once.  You both got\\ninto your right places, and I felt sure that it was well off with the\\nold love before it was on with the new, that I could honestly share my\\nheart between sister Jo and wife Amy, and love them dearly. Will you\\nbelieve it, and go back to the happy old times when we first knew one\\nanother?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll believe it, with all my heart, but, Teddy, we never can be boy\\nand girl again.  The happy old times can\\'t come back, and we mustn\\'t\\nexpect it.  We are man and woman now, with sober work to do, for\\nplaytime is over, and we must give up frolicking.  I\\'m sure you feel\\nthis.  I see the change in you, and you\\'ll find it in me.  I shall miss\\nmy boy, but I shall love the man as much, and admire him more, because\\nhe means to be what I hoped he would.  We can\\'t be little playmates any\\nlonger, but we will be brother and sister, to love and help one another\\nall our lives, won\\'t we, Laurie?\"\\n\\nHe did not say a word, but took the hand she offered him, and laid his\\nface down on it for a minute, feeling that out of the grave of a boyish\\npassion, there had risen a beautiful, strong friendship to bless them\\nboth.  Presently Jo said cheerfully, for she didn\\'t want the coming\\nhome to be a sad one, \"I can\\'t make it true that you children are\\nreally married and going to set up housekeeping. Why, it seems only\\nyesterday that I was buttoning Amy\\'s pinafore, and pulling your hair\\nwhen you teased.  Mercy me, how time does fly!\"\\n\\n\"As one of the children is older than yourself, you needn\\'t talk so\\nlike a grandma.  I flatter myself I\\'m a \\'gentleman growed\\' as Peggotty\\nsaid of David, and when you see Amy, you\\'ll find her rather a\\nprecocious infant,\" said Laurie, looking amused at her maternal air.\\n\\n\"You may be a little older in years, but I\\'m ever so much older in\\nfeeling, Teddy.  Women always are, and this last year has been such a\\nhard one that I feel forty.\"\\n\\n\"Poor Jo!  We left you to bear it alone, while we went pleasuring. You\\nare older.  Here\\'s a line, and there\\'s another.  Unless you smile, your\\neyes look sad, and when I touched the cushion, just now, I found a tear\\non it.  You\\'ve had a great deal to bear, and had to bear it all alone.\\nWhat a selfish beast I\\'ve been!\" and Laurie pulled his own hair, with a\\nremorseful look.\\n\\nBut Jo only turned over the traitorous pillow, and answered, in a tone\\nwhich she tried to make more cheerful, \"No, I had Father and Mother to\\nhelp me, and the dear babies to comfort me, and the thought that you\\nand Amy were safe and happy, to make the troubles here easier to bear.\\nI am lonely, sometimes, but I dare say it\\'s good for me, and...\"\\n\\n\"You never shall be again,\" broke in Laurie, putting his arm about her,\\nas if to fence out every human ill.  \"Amy and I can\\'t get on without\\nyou, so you must come and teach \\'the children\\' to keep house, and go\\nhalves in everything, just as we used to do, and let us pet you, and\\nall be blissfully happy and friendly together.\"\\n\\n\"If I shouldn\\'t be in the way, it would be very pleasant.  I begin to\\nfeel quite young already, for somehow all my troubles seemed to fly\\naway when you came.  You always were a comfort, Teddy,\" and Jo leaned\\nher head on his shoulder, just as she did years ago, when Beth lay ill\\nand Laurie told her to hold on to him.\\n\\nHe looked down at her, wondering if she remembered the time, but Jo was\\nsmiling to herself, as if in truth her troubles had all vanished at his\\ncoming.\\n\\n\"You are the same Jo still, dropping tears about one minute, and\\nlaughing the next.  You look a little wicked now.  What is it, Grandma?\"\\n\\n\"I was wondering how you and Amy get on together.\"\\n\\n\"Like angels!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, of course, but which rules?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t mind telling you that she does now, at least I let her think\\nso, it pleases her, you know.  By-and-by we shall take turns, for\\nmarriage, they say, halves one\\'s rights and doubles one\\'s duties.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll go on as you begin, and Amy will rule you all the days of your\\nlife.\"\\n\\n\"Well, she does it so imperceptibly that I don\\'t think I shall mind\\nmuch.  She is the sort of woman who knows how to rule well.  In fact, I\\nrather like it, for she winds one round her finger as softly and\\nprettily as a skein of silk, and makes you feel as if she was doing you\\na favor all the while.\"\\n\\n\"That ever I should live to see you a henpecked husband and enjoying\\nit!\" cried Jo, with uplifted hands.\\n\\nIt was good to see Laurie square his shoulders, and smile with\\nmasculine scorn at that insinuation, as he replied, with his \"high and\\nmighty\" air, \"Amy is too well-bred for that, and I am not the sort of\\nman to submit to it.  My wife and I respect ourselves and one another\\ntoo much ever to tyrannize or quarrel.\"\\n\\nJo liked that, and thought the new dignity very becoming, but the boy\\nseemed changing very fast into the man, and regret mingled with her\\npleasure.\\n\\n\"I am sure of that.  Amy and you never did quarrel as we used to. She\\nis the sun and I the wind, in the fable, and the sun managed the man\\nbest, you remember.\"\\n\\n\"She can blow him up as well as shine on him,\" laughed Laurie. \"Such a\\nlecture as I got at Nice!  I give you my word it was a deal worse than\\nany of your scoldings, a regular rouser.  I\\'ll tell you all about it\\nsometime, she never will, because after telling me that she despised\\nand was ashamed of me, she lost her heart to the despicable party and\\nmarried the good-for-nothing.\"\\n\\n\"What baseness!  Well, if she abuses you, come to me, and I\\'ll defend\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"I look as if I needed it, don\\'t I?\" said Laurie, getting up and\\nstriking an attitude which suddenly changed from the imposing to the\\nrapturous, as Amy\\'s voice was heard calling, \"Where is she? Where\\'s my\\ndear old Jo?\"\\n\\nIn trooped the whole family, and everyone was hugged and kissed all\\nover again, and after several vain attempts, the three wanderers were\\nset down to be looked at and exulted over.  Mr. Laurence, hale and\\nhearty as ever, was quite as much improved as the others by his foreign\\ntour, for the crustiness seemed to be nearly gone, and the\\nold-fashioned courtliness had received a polish which made it kindlier\\nthan ever.  It was good to see him beam at \\'my children\\', as he called\\nthe young pair.  It was better still to see Amy pay him the daughterly\\nduty and affection which completely won his old heart, and best of all,\\nto watch Laurie revolve about the two, as if never tired of enjoying\\nthe pretty picture they made.\\n\\nThe minute she put her eyes upon Amy, Meg became conscious that her own\\ndress hadn\\'t a Parisian air, that young Mrs. Moffat would be entirely\\neclipsed by young Mrs. Laurence, and that \\'her ladyship\\' was altogether\\na most elegant and graceful woman.  Jo thought, as she watched the\\npair, \"How well they look together!  I was right, and Laurie has found\\nthe beautiful, accomplished girl who will become his home better than\\nclumsy old Jo, and be a pride, not a torment to him.\"  Mrs. March and\\nher husband smiled and nodded at each other with happy faces, for they\\nsaw that their youngest had done well, not only in worldly things, but\\nthe better wealth of love, confidence, and happiness.\\n\\nFor Amy\\'s face was full of the soft brightness which betokens a\\npeaceful heart, her voice had a new tenderness in it, and the cool,\\nprim carriage was changed to a gentle dignity, both womanly and\\nwinning. No little affectations marred it, and the cordial sweetness of\\nher manner was more charming than the new beauty or the old grace, for\\nit stamped her at once with the unmistakable sign of the true\\ngentlewoman she had hoped to become.\\n\\n\"Love has done much for our little girl,\" said her mother softly.\\n\\n\"She has had a good example before her all her life, my dear,\" Mr.\\nMarch whispered back, with a loving look at the worn face and gray head\\nbeside him.\\n\\nDaisy found it impossible to keep her eyes off her \\'pitty aunty\\', but\\nattached herself like a lap dog to the wonderful chatelaine full of\\ndelightful charms.  Demi paused to consider the new relationship before\\nhe compromised himself by the rash acceptance of a bribe, which took\\nthe tempting form of a family of wooden bears from Berne. A flank\\nmovement produced an unconditional surrender, however, for Laurie knew\\nwhere to have him.\\n\\n\"Young man, when I first had the honor of making your acquaintance you\\nhit me in the face.  Now I demand the satisfaction of a gentleman,\" and\\nwith that the tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small nephew\\nin a way that damaged his philosophical dignity as much as it delighted\\nhis boyish soul.\\n\\n\"Blest if she ain\\'t in silk from head to foot; ain\\'t it a relishin\\'\\nsight to see her settin\\' there as fine as a fiddle, and hear folks\\ncalling little Amy \\'Mis.  Laurence!\\'\" muttered old Hannah, who could\\nnot resist frequent \"peeks\" through the slide as she set the table in a\\nmost decidedly promiscuous manner.\\n\\nMercy on us, how they did talk! first one, then the other, then all\\nburst out together--trying to tell the history of three years in half\\nan hour.  It was fortunate that tea was at hand, to produce a lull and\\nprovide refreshment--for they would have been hoarse and faint if they\\nhad gone on much longer.  Such a happy procession as filed away into\\nthe little dining room! Mr. March proudly escorted Mrs. Laurence.  Mrs.\\nMarch as proudly leaned on the arm of \\'my son\\'. The old gentleman took\\nJo, with a whispered, \"You must be my girl now,\" and a glance at the\\nempty corner by the fire, that made Jo whisper back, \"I\\'ll try to fill\\nher place, sir.\"\\n\\nThe twins pranced behind, feeling that the millennium was at hand, for\\neveryone was so busy with the newcomers that they were left to revel at\\ntheir own sweet will, and you may be sure they made the most of the\\nopportunity.  Didn\\'t they steal sips of tea, stuff gingerbread ad\\nlibitum, get a hot biscuit apiece, and as a crowning trespass, didn\\'t\\nthey each whisk a captivating little tart into their tiny pockets,\\nthere to stick and crumble treacherously, teaching them that both human\\nnature and a pastry are frail? Burdened with the guilty consciousness\\nof the sequestered tarts, and fearing that Dodo\\'s sharp eyes would\\npierce the thin disguise of cambric and merino which hid their booty,\\nthe little sinners attached themselves to \\'Dranpa\\', who hadn\\'t his\\nspectacles on.  Amy, who was handed about like refreshments, returned\\nto the parlor on Father Laurence\\'s arm.  The others paired off as\\nbefore, and this arrangement left Jo companionless.  She did not mind\\nit at the minute, for she lingered to answer Hannah\\'s eager inquiry.\\n\\n\"Will Miss Amy ride in her coop (coupe), and use all them lovely silver\\ndishes that\\'s stored away over yander?\"\\n\\n\"Shouldn\\'t wonder if she drove six white horses, ate off gold plate,\\nand wore diamonds and point lace every day.  Teddy thinks nothing too\\ngood for her,\" returned Jo with infinite satisfaction.\\n\\n\"No more there is!  Will you have hash or fishballs for breakfast?\"\\nasked Hannah, who wisely mingled poetry and prose.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t care,\" and Jo shut the door, feeling that food was an\\nuncongenial topic just then.  She stood a minute looking at the party\\nvanishing above, and as Demi\\'s short plaid legs toiled up the last\\nstair, a sudden sense of loneliness came over her so strongly that she\\nlooked about her with dim eyes, as if to find something to lean upon,\\nfor even Teddy had deserted her.  If she had known what birthday gift\\nwas coming every minute nearer and nearer, she would not have said to\\nherself, \"I\\'ll weep a little weep when I go to bed. It won\\'t do to be\\ndismal now.\"  Then she drew her hand over her eyes, for one of her\\nboyish habits was never to know where her handkerchief was, and had\\njust managed to call up a smile when there came a knock at the porch\\ndoor.\\n\\nShe opened with hospitable haste, and started as if another ghost had\\ncome to surprise her, for there stood a tall bearded gentleman, beaming\\non her from the darkness like a midnight sun.\\n\\n\"Oh, Mr. Bhaer, I am so glad to see you!\" cried Jo, with a clutch, as\\nif she feared the night would swallow him up before she could get him\\nin.\\n\\n\"And I to see Miss Marsch, but no, you haf a party,\" and the Professor\\npaused as the sound of voices and the tap of dancing feet came down to\\nthem.\\n\\n\"No, we haven\\'t, only the family.  My sister and friends have just come\\nhome, and we are all very happy.  Come in, and make one of us.\"\\n\\nThough a very social man, I think Mr. Bhaer would have gone decorously\\naway, and come again another day, but how could he, when Jo shut the\\ndoor behind him, and bereft him of his hat? Perhaps her face had\\nsomething to do with it, for she forgot to hide her joy at seeing him,\\nand showed it with a frankness that proved irresistible to the solitary\\nman, whose welcome far exceeded his boldest hopes.\\n\\n\"If I shall not be Monsieur de Trop, I will so gladly see them all.\\nYou haf been ill, my friend?\"\\n\\nHe put the question abruptly, for, as Jo hung up his coat, the light\\nfell on her face, and he saw a change in it.\\n\\n\"Not ill, but tired and sorrowful.  We have had trouble since I saw you\\nlast.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, yes, I know.  My heart was sore for you when I heard that,\" and he\\nshook hands again, with such a sympathetic face that Jo felt as if no\\ncomfort could equal the look of the kind eyes, the grasp of the big,\\nwarm hand.\\n\\n\"Father, Mother, this is my friend, Professor Bhaer,\" she said, with a\\nface and tone of such irrepressible pride and pleasure that she might\\nas well have blown a trumpet and opened the door with a flourish.\\n\\nIf the stranger had any doubts about his reception, they were set at\\nrest in a minute by the cordial welcome he received. Everyone greeted\\nhim kindly, for Jo\\'s sake at first, but very soon they liked him for\\nhis own.  They could not help it, for he carried the talisman that\\nopens all hearts, and these simple people warmed to him at once,\\nfeeling even the more friendly because he was poor.  For poverty\\nenriches those who live above it, and is a sure passport to truly\\nhospitable spirits.  Mr. Bhaer sat looking about him with the air of a\\ntraveler who knocks at a strange door, and when it opens, finds himself\\nat home.  The children went to him like bees to a honeypot, and\\nestablishing themselves on each knee, proceeded to captivate him by\\nrifling his pockets, pulling his beard, and investigating his watch,\\nwith juvenile audacity.  The women telegraphed their approval to one\\nanother, and Mr. March, feeling that he had got a kindred spirit,\\nopened his choicest stores for his guest\\'s benefit, while silent John\\nlistened and enjoyed the talk, but said not a word, and Mr. Laurence\\nfound it impossible to go to sleep.\\n\\nIf Jo had not been otherwise engaged, Laurie\\'s behavior would have\\namused her, for a faint twinge, not of jealousy, but something like\\nsuspicion, caused that gentleman to stand aloof at first, and observe\\nthe newcomer with brotherly circumspection. But it did not last long.\\nHe got interested in spite of himself, and before he knew it, was drawn\\ninto the circle.  For Mr. Bhaer talked well in this genial atmosphere,\\nand did himself justice. He seldom spoke to Laurie, but he looked at\\nhim often, and a shadow would pass across his face, as if regretting\\nhis own lost youth, as he watched the young man in his prime.  Then his\\neyes would turn to Jo so wistfully that she would have surely answered\\nthe mute inquiry if she had seen it.  But Jo had her own eyes to take\\ncare of, and feeling that they could not be trusted, she prudently kept\\nthem on the little sock she was knitting, like a model maiden aunt.\\n\\nA stealthy glance now and then refreshed her like sips of fresh water\\nafter a dusty walk, for the sidelong peeps showed her several\\npropitious omens.  Mr. Bhaer\\'s face had lost the absent-minded\\nexpression, and looked all alive with interest in the present moment,\\nactually young and handsome, she thought, forgetting to compare him\\nwith Laurie, as she usually did strange men, to their great detriment.\\nThen he seemed quite inspired, though the burial customs of the\\nancients, to which the conversation had strayed, might not be\\nconsidered an exhilarating topic. Jo quite glowed with triumph when\\nTeddy got quenched in an argument, and thought to herself, as she\\nwatched her father\\'s absorbed face, \"How he would enjoy having such a\\nman as my Professor to talk with every day!\"  Lastly, Mr. Bhaer was\\ndressed in a new suit of black, which made him look more like a\\ngentleman than ever.  His bushy hair had been cut and smoothly brushed,\\nbut didn\\'t stay in order long, for in exciting moments, he rumpled it\\nup in the droll way he used to do, and Jo liked it rampantly erect\\nbetter than flat, because she thought it gave his fine forehead a\\nJove-like aspect.  Poor Jo, how she did glorify that plain man, as she\\nsat knitting away so quietly, yet letting nothing escape her, not even\\nthe fact that Mr. Bhaer actually had gold sleeve-buttons in his\\nimmaculate wristbands.\\n\\n\"Dear old fellow!  He couldn\\'t have got himself up with more care if\\nhe\\'d been going a-wooing,\" said Jo to herself, and then a sudden\\nthought born of the words made her blush so dreadfully that she had to\\ndrop her ball, and go down after it to hide her face.\\n\\nThe maneuver did not succeed as well as she expected, however, for\\nthough just in the act of setting fire to a funeral pyre, the Professor\\ndropped his torch, metaphorically speaking, and made a dive after the\\nlittle blue ball.  Of course they bumped their heads smartly together,\\nsaw stars, and both came up flushed and laughing, without the ball, to\\nresume their seats, wishing they had not left them.\\n\\nNobody knew where the evening went to, for Hannah skillfully abstracted\\nthe babies at an early hour, nodding like two rosy poppies, and Mr.\\nLaurence went home to rest.  The others sat round the fire, talking\\naway, utterly regardless of the lapse of time, till Meg, whose maternal\\nmind was impressed with a firm conviction that Daisy had tumbled out of\\nbed, and Demi set his nightgown afire studying the structure of\\nmatches, made a move to go.\\n\\n\"We must have our sing, in the good old way, for we are all together\\nagain once more,\" said Jo, feeling that a good shout would be a safe\\nand pleasant vent for the jubilant emotions of her soul.\\n\\nThey were not all there.  But no one found the words thoughtless or\\nuntrue, for Beth still seemed among them, a peaceful presence,\\ninvisible, but dearer than ever, since death could not break the\\nhousehold league that love made dissoluble.  The little chair stood in\\nits old place.  The tidy basket, with the bit of work she left\\nunfinished when the needle grew \\'so heavy\\', was still on its accustomed\\nshelf.  The beloved instrument, seldom touched now had not been moved,\\nand above it Beth\\'s face, serene and smiling, as in the early days,\\nlooked down upon them, seeming to say, \"Be happy.  I am here.\"\\n\\n\"Play something, Amy.  Let them hear how much you have improved,\" said\\nLaurie, with pardonable pride in his promising pupil.\\n\\nBut Amy whispered, with full eyes, as she twirled the faded stool, \"Not\\ntonight, dear.  I can\\'t show off tonight.\"\\n\\nBut she did show something better than brilliancy or skill, for she\\nsang Beth\\'s songs with a tender music in her voice which the best\\nmaster could not have taught, and touched the listener\\'s hearts with a\\nsweeter power than any other inspiration could have given her.  The\\nroom was very still, when the clear voice failed suddenly at the last\\nline of Beth\\'s favorite hymn.  It was hard to say...\\n\\n    Earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal;\\n\\nand Amy leaned against her husband, who stood behind her, feeling that\\nher welcome home was not quite perfect without Beth\\'s kiss.\\n\\n\"Now, we must finish with Mignon\\'s song, for Mr. Bhaer sings that,\"\\nsaid Jo, before the pause grew painful.  And Mr. Bhaer cleared his\\nthroat with a gratified \"Hem!\" as he stepped into the corner where Jo\\nstood, saying...\\n\\n\"You will sing with me?  We go excellently well together.\"\\n\\nA pleasing fiction, by the way, for Jo had no more idea of music than a\\ngrasshopper.  But she would have consented if he had proposed to sing a\\nwhole opera, and warbled away, blissfully regardless of time and tune.\\nIt didn\\'t much matter, for Mr. Bhaer sang like a true German, heartily\\nand well, and Jo soon subsided into a subdued hum, that she might\\nlisten to the mellow voice that seemed to sing for her alone.\\n\\n    Know\\'st thou the land where the citron blooms,\\n\\nused to be the Professor\\'s favorite line, for \\'das land\\' meant Germany\\nto him, but now he seemed to dwell, with peculiar warmth and melody,\\nupon the words...\\n\\n    There, oh there, might I with thee,\\n    O, my beloved, go\\n\\nand one listener was so thrilled by the tender invitation that she\\nlonged to say she did know the land, and would joyfully depart thither\\nwhenever he liked.\\n\\nThe song was considered a great success, and the singer retired covered\\nwith laurels.  But a few minutes afterward, he forgot his manners\\nentirely, and stared at Amy putting on her bonnet, for she had been\\nintroduced simply as \\'my sister\\', and no one had called her by her new\\nname since he came.  He forgot himself still further when Laurie said,\\nin his most gracious manner, at parting...\\n\\n\"My wife and I are very glad to meet you, sir.  Please remember that\\nthere is always a welcome waiting for you over the way.\"\\n\\nThen the Professor thanked him so heartily, and looked so suddenly\\nilluminated with satisfaction, that Laurie thought him the most\\ndelightfully demonstrative old fellow he ever met.\\n\\n\"I too shall go, but I shall gladly come again, if you will gif me\\nleave, dear madame, for a little business in the city will keep me here\\nsome days.\"\\n\\nHe spoke to Mrs. March, but he looked at Jo, and the mother\\'s voice\\ngave as cordial an assent as did the daughter\\'s eyes, for Mrs. March\\nwas not so blind to her children\\'s interest as Mrs. Moffat supposed.\\n\\n\"I suspect that is a wise man,\" remarked Mr. March, with placid\\nsatisfaction, from the hearthrug, after the last guest had gone.\\n\\n\"I know he is a good one,\" added Mrs. March, with decided approval, as\\nshe wound up the clock.\\n\\n\"I thought you\\'d like him,\" was all Jo said, as she slipped away to her\\nbed.\\n\\nShe wondered what the business was that brought Mr. Bhaer to the city,\\nand finally decided that he had been appointed to some great honor,\\nsomewhere, but had been too modest to mention the fact.  If she had\\nseen his face when, safe in his own room, he looked at the picture of a\\nsevere and rigid young lady, with a good deal of hair, who appeared to\\nbe gazing darkly into futurity, it might have thrown some light upon\\nthe subject, especially when he turned off the gas, and kissed the\\npicture in the dark.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'FORTY-FOUR\\n\\nMY LORD AND LADY\\n\\n\"Please, Madam Mother, could you lend me my wife for half an hour?  The\\nluggage has come, and I\\'ve been making hay of Amy\\'s Paris finery,\\ntrying to find some things I want,\" said Laurie, coming in the next day\\nto find Mrs. Laurence sitting in her mother\\'s lap, as if being made\\n\\'the baby\\' again.\\n\\n\"Certainly.  Go, dear, I forgot that you have any home but this,\" and\\nMrs. March pressed the white hand that wore the wedding ring, as if\\nasking pardon for her maternal covetousness.\\n\\n\"I shouldn\\'t have come over if I could have helped it, but I can\\'t get\\non without my little woman any more than a...\"\\n\\n\"Weathercock can without the wind,\" suggested Jo, as he paused for a\\nsimile.  Jo had grown quite her own saucy self again since Teddy came\\nhome.\\n\\n\"Exactly, for Amy keeps me pointing due west most of the time, with\\nonly an occasional whiffle round to the south, and I haven\\'t had an\\neasterly spell since I was married.  Don\\'t know anything about the\\nnorth, but am altogether salubrious and balmy, hey, my lady?\"\\n\\n\"Lovely weather so far.  I don\\'t know how long it will last, but I\\'m\\nnot afraid of storms, for I\\'m learning how to sail my ship.  Come home,\\ndear, and I\\'ll find your bootjack.  I suppose that\\'s what you are\\nrummaging after among my things.  Men are so helpless, Mother,\" said\\nAmy, with a matronly air, which delighted her husband.\\n\\n\"What are you going to do with yourselves after you get settled?\" asked\\nJo, buttoning Amy\\'s cloak as she used to button her pinafores.\\n\\n\"We have our plans.  We don\\'t mean to say much about them yet, because\\nwe are such very new brooms, but we don\\'t intend to be idle.  I\\'m going\\ninto business with a devotion that shall delight Grandfather, and prove\\nto him that I\\'m not spoiled.  I need something of the sort to keep me\\nsteady.  I\\'m tired of dawdling, and mean to work like a man.\"\\n\\n\"And Amy, what is she going to do?\" asked Mrs. March, well pleased at\\nLaurie\\'s decision and the energy with which he spoke.\\n\\n\"After doing the civil all round, and airing our best bonnet, we shall\\nastonish you by the elegant hospitalities of our mansion, the brilliant\\nsociety we shall draw about us, and the beneficial influence we shall\\nexert over the world at large.  That\\'s about it, isn\\'t it, Madame\\nRecamier?\" asked Laurie with a quizzical look at Amy.\\n\\n\"Time will show.  Come away, Impertinence, and don\\'t shock my family by\\ncalling me names before their faces,\" answered Amy, resolving that\\nthere should be a home with a good wife in it before she set up a salon\\nas a queen of society.\\n\\n\"How happy those children seem together!\" observed Mr. March, finding\\nit difficult to become absorbed in his Aristotle after the young couple\\nhad gone.\\n\\n\"Yes, and I think it will last,\" added Mrs. March, with the restful\\nexpression of a pilot who has brought a ship safely into port.\\n\\n\"I know it will.  Happy Amy!\" and Jo sighed, then smiled brightly as\\nProfessor Bhaer opened the gate with an impatient push.\\n\\nLater in the evening, when his mind had been set at rest about the\\nbootjack, Laurie said suddenly to his wife, \"Mrs. Laurence.\"\\n\\n\"My Lord!\"\\n\\n\"That man intends to marry our Jo!\"\\n\\n\"I hope so, don\\'t you, dear?\"\\n\\n\"Well, my love, I consider him a trump, in the fullest sense of that\\nexpressive word, but I do wish he was a little younger and a good deal\\nricher.\"\\n\\n\"Now, Laurie, don\\'t be too fastidious and worldly-minded. If they love\\none another it doesn\\'t matter a particle how old they are nor how poor.\\nWomen never should marry for money...\" Amy caught herself up short as\\nthe words escaped her, and looked at her husband, who replied, with\\nmalicious gravity...\\n\\n\"Certainly not, though you do hear charming girls say that they intend\\nto do it sometimes.  If my memory serves me, you once thought it your\\nduty to make a rich match.  That accounts, perhaps, for your marrying a\\ngood-for-nothing like me.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, my dearest boy, don\\'t, don\\'t say that!  I forgot you were rich\\nwhen I said \\'Yes\\'.  I\\'d have married you if you hadn\\'t a penny, and I\\nsometimes wish you were poor that I might show how much I love you.\"\\nAnd Amy, who was very dignified in public and very fond in private,\\ngave convincing proofs of the truth of her words.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t really think I am such a mercenary creature as I tried to be\\nonce, do you?  It would break my heart if you didn\\'t believe that I\\'d\\ngladly pull in the same boat with you, even if you had to get your\\nliving by rowing on the lake.\"\\n\\n\"Am I an idiot and a brute?  How could I think so, when you refused a\\nricher man for me, and won\\'t let me give you half I want to now, when I\\nhave the right?  Girls do it every day, poor things, and are taught to\\nthink it is their only salvation, but you had better lessons, and\\nthough I trembled for you at one time, I was not disappointed, for the\\ndaughter was true to the mother\\'s teaching.  I told Mamma so yesterday,\\nand she looked as glad and grateful as if I\\'d given her a check for a\\nmillion, to be spent in charity.  You are not listening to my moral\\nremarks, Mrs. Laurence,\" and Laurie paused, for Amy\\'s eyes had an\\nabsent look, though fixed upon his face.\\n\\n\"Yes, I am, and admiring the mole in your chin at the same time.  I\\ndon\\'t wish to make you vain, but I must confess that I\\'m prouder of my\\nhandsome husband than of all his money. Don\\'t laugh, but your nose is\\nsuch a comfort to me,\" and Amy softly caressed the well-cut feature\\nwith artistic satisfaction.\\n\\nLaurie had received many compliments in his life, but never one that\\nsuited him better, as he plainly showed though he did laugh at his\\nwife\\'s peculiar taste, while she said slowly, \"May I ask you a\\nquestion, dear?\"\\n\\n\"Of course, you may.\"\\n\\n\"Shall you care if Jo does marry Mr. Bhaer?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, that\\'s the trouble is it?  I thought there was something in the\\ndimple that didn\\'t quite suit you.  Not being a dog in the manger, but\\nthe happiest fellow alive, I assure you I can dance at Jo\\'s wedding\\nwith a heart as light as my heels.  Do you doubt it, my darling?\"\\n\\nAmy looked up at him, and was satisfied.  Her little jealous fear\\nvanished forever, and she thanked him, with a face full of love and\\nconfidence.\\n\\n\"I wish we could do something for that capital old Professor. Couldn\\'t\\nwe invent a rich relation, who shall obligingly die out there in\\nGermany, and leave him a tidy little fortune?\" said Laurie, when they\\nbegan to pace up and down the long drawing room, arm in arm, as they\\nwere fond of doing, in memory of the chateau garden.\\n\\n\"Jo would find us out, and spoil it all.  She is very proud of him,\\njust as he is, and said yesterday that she thought poverty was a\\nbeautiful thing.\"\\n\\n\"Bless her dear heart!  She won\\'t think so when she has a literary\\nhusband, and a dozen little professors and professorins to support.  We\\nwon\\'t interfere now, but watch our chance, and do them a good turn in\\nspite of themselves.  I owe Jo for a part of my education, and she\\nbelieves in people\\'s paying their honest debts, so I\\'ll get round her\\nin that way.\"\\n\\n\"How delightful it is to be able to help others, isn\\'t it? That was\\nalways one of my dreams, to have the power of giving freely, and thanks\\nto you, the dream has come true.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, we\\'ll do quantities of good, won\\'t we?  There\\'s one sort of\\npoverty that I particularly like to help.  Out-and-out beggars get\\ntaken care of, but poor gentle folks fare badly, because they won\\'t\\nask, and people don\\'t dare to offer charity. Yet there are a thousand\\nways of helping them, if one only knows how to do it so delicately that\\nit does not offend.  I must say, I like to serve a decayed gentleman\\nbetter than a blarnerying beggar.  I suppose it\\'s wrong, but I do,\\nthough it is harder.\"\\n\\n\"Because it takes a gentleman to do it,\" added the other member of the\\ndomestic admiration society.\\n\\n\"Thank you, I\\'m afraid I don\\'t deserve that pretty compliment. But I\\nwas going to say that while I was dawdling about abroad, I saw a good\\nmany talented young fellows making all sorts of sacrifices, and\\nenduring real hardships, that they might realize their dreams. Splendid\\nfellows, some of them, working like heros,  poor and friendless, but so\\nfull of courage, patience, and ambition that I was ashamed of myself,\\nand longed to give them a right good lift.  Those are people whom it\\'s\\na satisfaction to help, for if they\\'ve got genius, it\\'s an honor to be\\nallowed to serve them, and not let it be lost or delayed for want of\\nfuel to keep the pot boiling.  If they haven\\'t, it\\'s a pleasure to\\ncomfort the poor souls, and keep them from despair when they find it\\nout.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, indeed, and there\\'s another class who can\\'t ask, and who suffer\\nin silence.  I know something of it, for I belonged to it before you\\nmade a princess of me, as the king does the beggarmaid in the old\\nstory.  Ambitious girls have a hard time, Laurie, and often have to see\\nyouth, health, and precious opportunities go by, just for want of a\\nlittle help at the right minute.  People have been very kind to me, and\\nwhenever I see girls struggling along, as we used to do, I want to put\\nout my hand and help them, as I was helped.\"\\n\\n\"And so you shall, like an angel as you are!\" cried Laurie, resolving,\\nwith a glow of philanthropic zeal, to found and endow an institution\\nfor the express benefit of young women with artistic tendencies.  \"Rich\\npeople have no right to sit down and enjoy themselves, or let their\\nmoney accumulate for others to waste.  It\\'s not half so sensible to\\nleave legacies when one dies as it is to use the money wisely while\\nalive, and enjoy making one\\'s fellow creatures happy with it.  We\\'ll\\nhave a good time ourselves, and add an extra relish to our own pleasure\\nby giving other people a generous taste.  Will you be a little Dorcas,\\ngoing about emptying a big basket of comforts, and filling it up with\\ngood deeds?\"\\n\\n\"With all my heart, if you will be a brave St.  Martin, stopping as you\\nride gallantly through the world to share your cloak with the beggar.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a bargain, and we shall get the best of it!\"\\n\\nSo the young pair shook hands upon it, and then paced happily on again,\\nfeeling that their pleasant home was more homelike because they hoped\\nto brighten other homes, believing that their own feet would walk more\\nuprightly along the flowery path before them, if they smoothed rough\\nways for other feet, and feeling that their hearts were more closely\\nknit together by a love which could tenderly remember those less blest\\nthan they.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'FORTY-FIVE\\n\\nDAISY AND DEMI\\n\\nI cannot feel that I have done my duty as humble historian of the March\\nfamily, without devoting at least one chapter to the two most precious\\nand important members of it.  Daisy and Demi had now arrived at years\\nof discretion, for in this fast age babies of three or four assert\\ntheir rights, and get them, too, which is more than many of their\\nelders do.  If there ever were a pair of twins in danger of being\\nutterly spoiled by adoration, it was these prattling Brookes.  Of\\ncourse they were the most remarkable children ever born, as will be\\nshown when I mention that they walked at eight months, talked fluently\\nat twelve months, and at two years they took their places at table, and\\nbehaved with a propriety which charmed all beholders. At three, Daisy\\ndemanded a \\'needler\\', and actually made a bag with four stitches in it.\\nShe likewise set up housekeeping in the sideboard, and managed a\\nmicroscopic cooking stove with a skill that brought tears of pride to\\nHannah\\'s eyes, while Demi learned his letters with his grandfather, who\\ninvented a new mode of teaching the alphabet by forming letters with\\nhis arms and legs, thus uniting gymnastics for head and heels.  The boy\\nearly developed a mechanical genius which delighted his father and\\ndistracted his mother, for he tried to imitate every machine he saw,\\nand kept the nursery in a chaotic condition, with his \\'sewinsheen\\', a\\nmysterious structure of string, chairs, clothespins, and spools, for\\nwheels to go \\'wound and wound\\'.  Also a basket hung over the back of a\\nchair, in which he vainly tried to hoist his too confiding sister, who,\\nwith feminine devotion, allowed her little head to be bumped till\\nrescued, when the young inventor indignantly remarked, \"Why, Marmar,\\ndat\\'s my lellywaiter, and me\\'s trying to pull her up.\"\\n\\nThough utterly unlike in character, the twins got on remarkably well\\ntogether, and seldom quarreled more than thrice a day.  Of course, Demi\\ntyrannized over Daisy, and gallantly defended her from every other\\naggressor, while Daisy made a galley slave of herself, and adored her\\nbrother as the one perfect being in the world.  A rosy, chubby,\\nsunshiny little soul was Daisy, who found her way to everybody\\'s heart,\\nand nestled there.  One of the captivating children, who seem made to\\nbe kissed and cuddled, adorned and adored like little goddesses, and\\nproduced for general approval on all festive occasions. Her small\\nvirtues were so sweet that she would have been quite angelic if a few\\nsmall naughtinesses had not kept her delightfully human.  It was all\\nfair weather in her world, and every morning she scrambled up to the\\nwindow in her little nightgown to look out, and say, no matter whether\\nit rained or shone, \"Oh, pitty day, oh, pitty day!\" Everyone was a\\nfriend, and she offered kisses to a stranger so confidingly that the\\nmost inveterate bachelor relented, and baby-lovers became faithful\\nworshipers.\\n\\n\"Me loves evvybody,\" she once said, opening her arms, with her spoon in\\none hand, and her mug in the other, as if eager to embrace and nourish\\nthe whole world.\\n\\nAs she grew, her mother began to feel that the Dovecote would be\\nblessed by the presence of an inmate as serene and loving as that which\\nhad helped to make the old house home, and to pray that she might be\\nspared a loss like that which had lately taught them how long they had\\nentertained an angel unawares.  Her grandfather often called her\\n\\'Beth\\', and her grandmother watched over her with untiring devotion, as\\nif trying to atone for some past mistake, which no eye but her own\\ncould see.\\n\\nDemi, like a true Yankee, was of an inquiring turn, wanting to know\\neverything, and often getting much disturbed because he could not get\\nsatisfactory answers to his perpetual \"What for?\"\\n\\nHe also possessed a philosophic bent, to the great delight of his\\ngrandfather, who used to hold Socratic conversations with him, in which\\nthe precocious pupil occasionally posed his teacher, to the undisguised\\nsatisfaction of the womenfolk.\\n\\n\"What makes my legs go, Dranpa?\" asked the young philosopher, surveying\\nthose active portions of his frame with a meditative air, while resting\\nafter a go-to-bed frolic one night.\\n\\n\"It\\'s your little mind, Demi,\" replied the sage, stroking the yellow\\nhead respectfully.\\n\\n\"What is a little mine?\"\\n\\n\"It is something which makes your body move, as the spring made the\\nwheels go in my watch when I showed it to you.\"\\n\\n\"Open me.  I want to see it go wound.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t do that any more than you could open the watch.  God winds you\\nup, and you go till He stops you.\"\\n\\n\"Does I?\" and Demi\\'s brown eyes grew big and bright as he took in the\\nnew thought.  \"Is I wounded up like the watch?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but I can\\'t show you how, for it is done when we don\\'t see.\"\\n\\nDemi felt his back, as if expecting to find it like that of the watch,\\nand then gravely remarked, \"I dess Dod does it when I\\'s asleep.\"\\n\\nA careful explanation followed, to which he listened so attentively\\nthat his anxious grandmother said, \"My dear, do you think it wise to\\ntalk about such things to that baby?  He\\'s getting great bumps over his\\neyes, and learning to ask the most unanswerable questions.\"\\n\\n\"If he is old enough to ask the question he is old enough to receive\\ntrue answers.  I am not putting the thoughts into his head, but helping\\nhim unfold those already there.  These children are wiser than we are,\\nand I have no doubt the boy understands every word I have said to him.\\nNow, Demi, tell me where you keep your mind.\"\\n\\nIf the boy had replied like Alcibiades, \"By the gods, Socrates, I\\ncannot tell,\" his grandfather would not have been surprised, but when,\\nafter standing a moment on one leg, like a meditative young stork, he\\nanswered, in a tone of calm conviction, \"In my little belly,\" the old\\ngentleman could only join in Grandma\\'s laugh, and dismiss the class in\\nmetaphysics.\\n\\nThere might have been cause for maternal anxiety, if Demi had not given\\nconvincing proofs that he was a true boy, as well as a budding\\nphilosopher, for often, after a discussion which caused Hannah to\\nprophesy, with ominous nods, \"That child ain\\'t long for this world,\" he\\nwould turn about and set her fears at rest by some of the pranks with\\nwhich dear, dirty, naughty little rascals distract and delight their\\nparent\\'s souls.\\n\\nMeg made many moral rules, and tried to keep them, but what mother was\\never proof against the winning wiles, the ingenious evasions, or the\\ntranquil audacity of the miniature men and women who so early show\\nthemselves accomplished Artful Dodgers?\\n\\n\"No more raisins, Demi.  They\\'ll make you sick,\" says Mamma to the\\nyoung person who offers his services in the kitchen with unfailing\\nregularity on plum-pudding day.\\n\\n\"Me likes to be sick.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want to have you, so run away and help Daisy make patty cakes.\"\\n\\nHe reluctantly departs, but his wrongs weigh upon his spirit, and\\nby-and-by when an opportunity comes to redress them, he outwits Mamma\\nby a shrewd bargain.\\n\\n\"Now you have been good children, and I\\'ll play anything you like,\"\\nsays Meg, as she leads her assistant cooks upstairs, when the pudding\\nis safely bouncing in the pot.\\n\\n\"Truly, Marmar?\" asks Demi, with a brilliant idea in his well-powdered\\nhead.\\n\\n\"Yes, truly.  Anything you say,\" replies the shortsighted parent,\\npreparing herself to sing, \"The Three Little Kittens\" half a dozen\\ntimes over, or to take her family to \"Buy a penny bun,\" regardless of\\nwind or limb.  But Demi corners her by the cool reply...\\n\\n\"Then we\\'ll go and eat up all the raisins.\"\\n\\nAunt Dodo was chief playmate and confidante of both children, and the\\ntrio turned the little house topsy-turvy.  Aunt Amy was as yet only a\\nname to them, Aunt Beth soon faded into a pleasantly vague memory, but\\nAunt Dodo was a living reality, and they made the most of her, for\\nwhich compliment she was deeply grateful.  But when Mr. Bhaer came, Jo\\nneglected her playfellows, and dismay and desolation fell upon their\\nlittle souls.  Daisy, who was fond of going about peddling kisses, lost\\nher best customer and became bankrupt.  Demi, with infantile\\npenetration, soon discovered that Dodo like to play with \\'the bear-man\\'\\nbetter than she did him, but though hurt, he concealed his anguish, for\\nhe hadn\\'t the heart to insult a rival who kept a mine of chocolate\\ndrops in his waistcoat pocket, and a watch that could be taken out of\\nits case and freely shaken by ardent admirers.\\n\\nSome persons might have considered these pleasing liberties as bribes,\\nbut Demi didn\\'t see it in that light, and continued to patronize the\\n\\'the bear-man\\' with pensive affability, while Daisy bestowed her small\\naffections upon him at the third call, and considered his shoulder her\\nthrone, his arm her refuge, his gifts treasures surpassing worth.\\n\\nGentlemen are sometimes seized with sudden fits of admiration for the\\nyoung relatives of ladies whom they honor with their regard, but this\\ncounterfeit philoprogenitiveness sits uneasily upon them, and does not\\ndeceive anybody a particle.  Mr. Bhaer\\'s devotion was sincere, however\\nlikewise effective--for honesty is the best policy in love as in law.\\nHe was one of the men who are at home with children, and looked\\nparticularly well when little faces made a pleasant contrast with his\\nmanly one.  His business, whatever it was, detained him from day to\\nday, but evening seldom failed to bring him out to see--well, he always\\nasked for Mr. March, so I suppose he was the attraction.  The excellent\\npapa labored under the delusion that he was, and reveled in long\\ndiscussions with the kindred spirit, till a chance remark of his more\\nobserving grandson suddenly enlightened him.\\n\\nMr. Bhaer came in one evening to pause on the threshold of the study,\\nastonished by the spectacle that met his eye.  Prone upon the floor lay\\nMr. March, with his respectable legs in the air, and beside him,\\nlikewise prone, was Demi, trying to imitate the attitude with his own\\nshort, scarlet-stockinged legs, both grovelers so seriously absorbed\\nthat they were unconscious of spectators, till Mr. Bhaer laughed his\\nsonorous laugh, and Jo cried out, with a scandalized face...\\n\\n\"Father, Father, here\\'s the Professor!\"\\n\\nDown went the black legs and up came the gray head, as the preceptor\\nsaid, with undisturbed dignity, \"Good evening, Mr. Bhaer. Excuse me for\\na moment.  We are just finishing our lesson.  Now, Demi, make the\\nletter and tell its name.\"\\n\\n\"I knows him!\" and, after a few convulsive efforts, the red legs took\\nthe shape of a pair of compasses, and the intelligent pupil\\ntriumphantly shouted, \"It\\'s a We, Dranpa, it\\'s a We!\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s a born Weller,\" laughed Jo, as her parent gathered himself up,\\nand her nephew tried to stand on his head, as the only mode of\\nexpressing his satisfaction that school was over.\\n\\n\"What have you been at today, bubchen?\" asked Mr. Bhaer, picking up the\\ngymnast.\\n\\n\"Me went to see little Mary.\"\\n\\n\"And what did you there?\"\\n\\n\"I kissed her,\" began Demi, with artless frankness.\\n\\n\"Prut!  Thou beginnest early.  What did the little Mary say to that?\"\\nasked Mr. Bhaer, continuing to confess the young sinner, who stood upon\\nthe knee, exploring the waistcoat pocket.\\n\\n\"Oh, she liked it, and she kissed me, and I liked it.  Don\\'t little\\nboys like little girls?\" asked Demi, with his mouth full, and an air of\\nbland satisfaction.\\n\\n\"You precocious chick!  Who put that into your head?\" said Jo, enjoying\\nthe innocent revelation as much as the Professor.\\n\\n\"\\'Tisn\\'t in mine head, it\\'s in mine mouf,\" answered literal Demi,\\nputting out his tongue, with a chocolate drop on it, thinking she\\nalluded to confectionery, not ideas.\\n\\n\"Thou shouldst save some for the little friend.  Sweets to the sweet,\\nmannling,\" and Mr. Bhaer offered Jo some, with a look that made her\\nwonder if chocolate was not the nectar drunk by the gods.  Demi also\\nsaw the smile, was impressed by it, and artlessy inquired.  ..\\n\\n\"Do great boys like great girls, to, \\'Fessor?\"\\n\\nLike young Washington, Mr. Bhaer \\'couldn\\'t tell a lie\\', so he gave the\\nsomewhat vague reply that he believed they did sometimes, in a tone\\nthat made Mr. March put down his clothesbrush, glance at Jo\\'s retiring\\nface, and then sink into his chair, looking as if the \\'precocious\\nchick\\' had put an idea into his head that was both sweet and sour.\\n\\nWhy Dodo, when she caught him in the china closet half an hour\\nafterward, nearly squeezed the breath out of his little body with a\\ntender embrace, instead of shaking him for being there, and why she\\nfollowed up this novel performance by the unexpected gift of a big\\nslice of bread and jelly, remained one of the problems over which Demi\\npuzzled his small wits, and was forced to leave unsolved forever.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'FORTY-SIX\\n\\nUNDER THE UMBRELLA\\n\\nWhile Laurie and Amy were taking conjugal strolls over velvet carpets,\\nas they set their house in order, and planned a blissful future, Mr.\\nBhaer and Jo were enjoying promenades of a different sort, along muddy\\nroads and sodden fields.\\n\\n\"I always do take a walk toward evening, and I don\\'t know why I should\\ngive it up, just because I happen to meet the Professor on his way\\nout,\" said Jo to herself, after two or three encounters, for though\\nthere were two paths to Meg\\'s whichever one she took she was sure to\\nmeet him, either going or returning. He was always walking rapidly, and\\nnever seemed to see her until quite close, when he would look as if his\\nshort-sighted eyes had failed to recognize the approaching lady till\\nthat moment.  Then, if she was going to Meg\\'s he always had something\\nfor the babies.  If her face was turned homeward, he had merely\\nstrolled down to see the river, and was just returning, unless they\\nwere tired of his frequent calls.\\n\\nUnder the circumstances, what could Jo do but greet him civilly, and\\ninvite him in?  If she was tired of his visits, she concealed her\\nweariness with perfect skill, and took care that there should be coffee\\nfor supper, \"as Friedrich--I mean Mr. Bhaer--doesn\\'t like tea.\"\\n\\nBy the second week, everyone knew perfectly well what was going on, yet\\neveryone tried to look as if they were stone-blind to the changes in\\nJo\\'s face.  They never asked why she sang about her work, did up her\\nhair three times a day, and got so blooming with her evening exercise.\\nAnd no one seemed to have the slightest suspicion that Professor Bhaer,\\nwhile talking philosophy with the father, was giving the daughter\\nlessons in love.\\n\\nJo couldn\\'t even lose her heart in a decorous manner, but sternly tried\\nto quench her feelings, and failing to do so, led a somewhat agitated\\nlife.  She was mortally afraid of being laughed at for surrendering,\\nafter her many and vehement declarations of independence.  Laurie was\\nher especial dread, but thanks to the new manager, he behaved with\\npraiseworthy propriety, never called Mr. Bhaer \\'a capital old fellow\\'\\nin public, never alluded, in the remotest manner, to Jo\\'s improved\\nappearance, or expressed the least surprise at seeing the Professor\\'s\\nhat on the Marches\\' table nearly every evening.  But he exulted in\\nprivate and longed for the time to come when he could give Jo a piece\\nof plate, with a bear and a ragged staff on it as an appropriate coat\\nof arms.\\n\\nFor a fortnight, the Professor came and went with lover-like\\nregularity.  Then he stayed away for three whole days, and made no\\nsign, a proceeding which caused everybody to look sober, and Jo to\\nbecome pensive, at first, and then--alas for romance--very cross.\\n\\n\"Disgusted, I dare say, and gone home as suddenly as he came. It\\'s\\nnothing to me, of course, but I should think he would have come and bid\\nus goodbye like a gentleman,\" she said to herself, with a despairing\\nlook at the gate, as she put on her things for the customary walk one\\ndull afternoon.\\n\\n\"You\\'d better take the little umbrella, dear.  It looks like rain,\"\\nsaid her mother, observing that she had on her new bonnet, but not\\nalluding to the fact.\\n\\n\"Yes, Marmee, do you want anything in town?  I\\'ve got to run in and get\\nsome paper,\" returned Jo, pulling out the bow under her chin before the\\nglass as an excuse for not looking at her mother.\\n\\n\"Yes, I want some twilled silesia, a paper of number nine needles, and\\ntwo yards of narrow lavender ribbon.  Have you got your thick boots on,\\nand something warm under your cloak?\"\\n\\n\"I believe so,\" answered Jo absently.\\n\\n\"If you happen to meet Mr. Bhaer, bring him home to tea. I quite long\\nto see the dear man,\" added Mrs. March.\\n\\nJo heard that, but made no answer, except to kiss her mother, and walk\\nrapidly away, thinking with a glow of gratitude, in spite of her\\nheartache, \"How good she is to me! What do girls do who haven\\'t any\\nmothers to help them through their troubles?\"\\n\\nThe dry-goods stores were not down among the counting-houses, banks,\\nand wholesale warerooms, where gentlemen most do congregate, but Jo\\nfound herself in that part of the city before she did a single errand,\\nloitering along as if waiting for someone, examining engineering\\ninstruments in one window and samples of wool in another, with most\\nunfeminine interest, tumbling over barrels, being half-smothered by\\ndescending bales, and hustled unceremoniously by busy men who looked as\\nif they wondered \\'how the deuce she got there\\'.  A drop of rain on her\\ncheek recalled her thoughts from baffled hopes to ruined ribbons.  For\\nthe drops continued to fall, and being a woman as well as a lover, she\\nfelt that, though it was too late to save her heart, she might her\\nbonnet.  Now she remembered the little umbrella, which she had\\nforgotten to take in her hurry to be off, but regret was unavailing,\\nand nothing could be done but borrow one or submit to a drenching.  She\\nlooked up at the lowering sky, down at the crimson bow already flecked\\nwith black, forward along the muddy street, then one long, lingering\\nlook behind, at a certain grimy warehouse, with \\'Hoffmann, Swartz, &\\nCo.\\' over the door, and said to herself, with a sternly reproachful\\nair...\\n\\n\"It serves me right! what business had I to put on all my best things\\nand come philandering down here, hoping to see the Professor?  Jo, I\\'m\\nashamed of you!  No, you shall not go there to borrow an umbrella, or\\nfind out where he is, from his friends. You shall trudge away, and do\\nyour errands in the rain, and if you catch your death and ruin your\\nbonnet, it\\'s no more than you deserve.  Now then!\"\\n\\nWith that she rushed across the street so impetuously that she narrowly\\nescaped annihilation from a passing truck, and precipitated herself\\ninto the arms of a stately old gentleman, who said, \"I beg pardon,\\nma\\'am,\" and looked mortally offended.  Somewhat daunted, Jo righted\\nherself, spread her handkerchief over the devoted ribbons, and putting\\ntemptation behind her, hurried on, with increasing dampness about the\\nankles, and much clashing of umbrellas overhead.  The fact that a\\nsomewhat dilapidated blue one remained stationary above the unprotected\\nbonnet attracted her attention, and looking up, she saw Mr. Bhaer\\nlooking down.\\n\\n\"I feel to know the strong-minded lady who goes so bravely under many\\nhorse noses, and so fast through much mud.  What do you down here, my\\nfriend?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m shopping.\"\\n\\nMr. Bhaer smiled, as he glanced from the pickle factory on one side to\\nthe wholesale hide and leather concern on the other, but he only said\\npolitely, \"You haf no umbrella.  May I go also, and take for you the\\nbundles?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, thank you.\"\\n\\nJo\\'s cheeks were as red as her ribbon, and she wondered what he thought\\nof her, but she didn\\'t care, for in a minute she found herself walking\\naway arm in arm with her Professor, feeling as if the sun had suddenly\\nburst out with uncommon brilliancy, that the world was all right again,\\nand that one thoroughly happy woman was paddling through the wet that\\nday.\\n\\n\"We thought you had gone,\" said Jo hastily, for she knew he was looking\\nat her.  Her bonnet wasn\\'t big enough to hide her face, and she feared\\nhe might think the joy it betrayed unmaidenly.\\n\\n\"Did you believe that I should go with no farewell to those who haf\\nbeen so heavenly kind to me?\" he asked so reproachfully that she felt\\nas if she had insulted him by the suggestion, and answered heartily...\\n\\n\"No, I didn\\'t.  I knew you were busy about your own affairs, but we\\nrather missed you, Father and Mother especially.\"\\n\\n\"And you?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m always glad to see you, sir.\"\\n\\nIn her anxiety to keep her voice quite calm, Jo made it rather cool,\\nand the frosty little monosyllable at the end seemed to chill the\\nProfessor, for his smile vanished, as he said gravely...\\n\\n\"I thank you, and come one more time before I go.\"\\n\\n\"You are going, then?\"\\n\\n\"I haf no longer any business here, it is done.\"\\n\\n\"Successfully, I hope?\" said Jo, for the bitterness of disappointment\\nwas in that short reply of his.\\n\\n\"I ought to think so, for I haf a way opened to me by which I can make\\nmy bread and gif my Junglings much help.\"\\n\\n\"Tell me, please!  I like to know all about the--the boys,\" said Jo\\neagerly.\\n\\n\"That is so kind, I gladly tell you.  My friends find for me a place in\\na college, where I teach as at home, and earn enough to make the way\\nsmooth for Franz and Emil.  For this I should be grateful, should I\\nnot?\"\\n\\n\"Indeed you should.  How splendid it will be to have you doing what you\\nlike, and be able to see you often, and the boys!\" cried Jo, clinging\\nto the lads as an excuse for the satisfaction she could not help\\nbetraying.\\n\\n\"Ah!  But we shall not meet often, I fear, this place is at the West.\"\\n\\n\"So far away!\" and Jo left her skirts to their fate, as if it didn\\'t\\nmatter now what became of her clothes or herself.\\n\\nMr. Bhaer could read several languages, but he had not learned to read\\nwomen yet.  He flattered himself that he knew Jo pretty well, and was,\\ntherefore, much amazed by the contradictions of voice, face, and\\nmanner, which she showed him in rapid succession that day, for she was\\nin half a dozen different moods in the course of half an hour.  When\\nshe met him she looked surprised, though it was impossible to help\\nsuspecting that she had come for that express purpose.  When he offered\\nher his arm, she took it with a look that filled him with delight, but\\nwhen he asked if she missed him, she gave such a chilly, formal reply\\nthat despair fell upon him.  On learning his good fortune she almost\\nclapped her hands.  Was the joy all for the boys? Then on hearing his\\ndestination, she said, \"So far away!\" in a tone of despair that lifted\\nhim on to a pinnacle of hope, but the next minute she tumbled him down\\nagain by observing, like one entirely absorbed in the matter...\\n\\n\"Here\\'s the place for my errands.  Will you come in? It won\\'t take\\nlong.\"\\n\\nJo rather prided herself upon her shopping capabilities, and\\nparticularly wished to impress her escort with the neatness and\\ndispatch with which she would accomplish the business. But owing to the\\nflutter she was in, everything went amiss. She upset the tray of\\nneedles, forgot the silesia was to be \\'twilled\\' till it was cut off,\\ngave the wrong change, and covered herself with confusion by asking for\\nlavender ribbon at the calico counter.  Mr. Bhaer stood by, watching\\nher blush and blunder, and as he watched, his own bewilderment seemed\\nto subside, for he was beginning to see that on some occasions, women,\\nlike dreams, go by contraries.\\n\\nWhen they came out, he put the parcel under his arm with a more\\ncheerful aspect, and splashed through the puddles as if he rather\\nenjoyed it on the whole.\\n\\n\"Should we no do a little what you call shopping for the babies, and\\nhaf a farewell feast tonight if I go for my last call at your so\\npleasant home?\" he asked, stopping before a window full of fruit and\\nflowers.\\n\\n\"What will we buy?\" asked Jo, ignoring the latter part of his speech,\\nand sniffing the mingled odors with an affectation of delight as they\\nwent in.\\n\\n\"May they haf oranges and figs?\" asked Mr. Bhaer, with a paternal air.\\n\\n\"They eat them when they can get them.\"\\n\\n\"Do you care for nuts?\"\\n\\n\"Like a squirrel.\"\\n\\n\"Hamburg grapes.  Yes, we shall drink to the Fatherland in those?\"\\n\\nJo frowned upon that piece of extravagance, and asked why he didn\\'t buy\\na frail of dates, a cask of raisins, and a bag of almonds, and be done\\nwith it?  Whereat Mr. Bhaer confiscated her purse, produced his own,\\nand finished the marketing by buying several pounds of grapes, a pot of\\nrosy daisies, and a pretty jar of honey, to be regarded in the light of\\na demijohn.  Then distorting his pockets with knobby bundles, and\\ngiving her the flowers to hold, he put up the old umbrella, and they\\ntraveled on again.\\n\\n\"Miss Marsch, I haf a great favor to ask of you,\" began the Professor,\\nafter a moist promenade of half a block.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir?\" and Jo\\'s heart began to beat so hard she was afraid he\\nwould hear it.\\n\\n\"I am bold to say it in spite of the rain, because so short a time\\nremains to me.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" and Jo nearly crushed the small flowerpot with the sudden\\nsqueeze she gave it.\\n\\n\"I wish to get a little dress for my Tina, and I am too stupid to go\\nalone.  Will you kindly gif me a word of taste and help?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" and Jo felt as calm and cool all of a sudden as if she had\\nstepped into a refrigerator.\\n\\n\"Perhaps also a shawl for Tina\\'s mother, she is so poor and sick, and\\nthe husband is such a care.  Yes, yes, a thick, warm shawl would be a\\nfriendly thing to take the little mother.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll do it with pleasure, Mr. Bhaer.\"  \"I\\'m going very fast, and he\\'s\\ngetting dearer every minute,\" added Jo to herself, then with a mental\\nshake she entered into the business with an energy that was pleasant to\\nbehold.\\n\\nMr. Bhaer left it all to her, so she chose a pretty gown for Tina, and\\nthen ordered out the shawls.  The clerk, being a married man,\\ncondescended to take an interest in the couple, who appeared to be\\nshopping for their family.\\n\\n\"Your lady may prefer this.  It\\'s a superior article, a most desirable\\ncolor, quite chaste and genteel,\" he said, shaking out a comfortable\\ngray shawl, and throwing it over Jo\\'s shoulders.\\n\\n\"Does this suit you, Mr. Bhaer?\" she asked, turning her back to him,\\nand feeling deeply grateful for the chance of hiding her face.\\n\\n\"Excellently well, we will haf it,\" answered the Professor, smiling to\\nhimself as he paid for it, while Jo continued to rummage the counters\\nlike a confirmed bargain-hunter.\\n\\n\"Now shall we go home?\" he asked, as if the words were very pleasant to\\nhim.\\n\\n\"Yes, it\\'s late, and I\\'m _so_ tired.\" Jo\\'s voice was more pathetic than\\nshe knew.  For now the sun seemed to have gone in as suddenly as it\\ncame out, and the world grew muddy and miserable again, and for the\\nfirst time she discovered that her feet were cold, her head ached, and\\nthat her heart was colder than the former, fuller of pain than the\\nlatter.  Mr. Bhaer was going away, he only cared for her as a friend,\\nit was all a mistake, and the sooner it was over the better.  With this\\nidea in her head, she hailed an approaching omnibus with such a hasty\\ngesture that the daisies flew out of the pot and were badly damaged.\\n\\n\"This is not our omniboos,\" said the Professor, waving the loaded\\nvehicle away, and stopping to pick up the poor little flowers.\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon.  I didn\\'t see the name distinctly.  Never mind, I\\ncan walk.  I\\'m used to plodding in the mud,\" returned Jo, winking hard,\\nbecause she would have died rather than openly wipe her eyes.\\n\\nMr. Bhaer saw the drops on her cheeks, though she turned her head away.\\nThe sight seemed to touch him very much, for suddenly stooping down, he\\nasked in a tone that meant a great deal, \"Heart\\'s dearest, why do you\\ncry?\"\\n\\nNow, if Jo had not been new to this sort of thing she would have said\\nshe wasn\\'t crying, had a cold in her head, or told any other feminine\\nfib proper to the occasion.  Instead of which, that undignified\\ncreature answered, with an irrepressible sob, \"Because you are going\\naway.\"\\n\\n\"Ach, mein Gott, that is so good!\" cried Mr. Bhaer, managing to clasp\\nhis hands in spite of the umbrella and the bundles, \"Jo, I haf nothing\\nbut much love to gif you.  I came to see if you could care for it, and\\nI waited to be sure that I was something more than a friend.  Am I?\\nCan you make a little place in your heart for old Fritz?\" he added, all\\nin one breath.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!\" said Jo, and he was quite satisfied, for she folded both\\nhands over his arm, and looked up at him with an expression that\\nplainly showed how happy she would be to walk through life beside him,\\neven though she had no better shelter than the old umbrella, if he\\ncarried it.\\n\\nIt was certainly proposing under difficulties, for even if he had\\ndesired to do so, Mr. Bhaer could not go down upon his knees, on\\naccount of the mud.  Neither could he offer Jo his hand, except\\nfiguratively, for both were full.  Much less could he indulge in tender\\nremonstrations in the open street, though he was near it.  So the only\\nway in which he could express his rapture was to look at her, with an\\nexpression which glorified his face to such a degree that there\\nactually seemed to be little rainbows in the drops that sparkled on his\\nbeard.  If he had not loved Jo very much, I don\\'t think he could have\\ndone it then, for she looked far from lovely, with her skirts in a\\ndeplorable state, her rubber boots splashed to the ankle, and her\\nbonnet a ruin.  Fortunately, Mr. Bhaer considered her the most\\nbeautiful woman living, and she found him more \"Jove-like\" than ever,\\nthough his hatbrim was quite limp with the little rills trickling\\nthence upon his shoulders (for he held the umbrella all over Jo), and\\nevery finger of his gloves needed mending.\\n\\nPassers-by probably thought them a pair of harmless lunatics, for they\\nentirely forgot to hail a bus, and strolled leisurely along, oblivious\\nof deepening dusk and fog.  Little they cared what anybody thought, for\\nthey were enjoying the happy hour that seldom comes but once in any\\nlife, the magical moment which bestows youth on the old, beauty on the\\nplain, wealth on the poor, and gives human hearts a foretaste of\\nheaven. The Professor looked as if he had conquered a kingdom, and the\\nworld had nothing more to offer him in the way of bliss.  While Jo\\ntrudged beside him, feeling as if her place had always been there, and\\nwondering how she ever could have chosen any other lot.  Of course, she\\nwas the first to speak--intelligibly, I mean, for the emotional remarks\\nwhich followed her impetuous \"Oh, yes!\" were not of a coherent or\\nreportable character.\\n\\n\"Friedrich, why didn\\'t you...\"\\n\\n\"Ah, heaven, she gifs me the name that no one speaks since Minna died!\"\\ncried the Professor, pausing in a puddle to regard her with grateful\\ndelight.\\n\\n\"I always call you so to myself--I forgot, but I won\\'t unless you like\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"Like it?  It is more sweet to me than I can tell.  Say \\'thou\\', also,\\nand I shall say your language is almost as beautiful as mine.\"\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t \\'thou\\' a little sentimental?\" asked Jo, privately thinking it a\\nlovely monosyllable.\\n\\n\"Sentimental? Yes.  Thank Gott, we Germans believe in sentiment, and\\nkeep ourselves young mit it.  Your English \\'you\\' is so cold, say\\n\\'thou\\', heart\\'s dearest, it means so much to me,\" pleaded Mr. Bhaer,\\nmore like a romantic student than a grave professor.\\n\\n\"Well, then, why didn\\'t thou tell me all this sooner?\" asked Jo\\nbashfully.\\n\\n\"Now I shall haf to show thee all my heart, and I so gladly will,\\nbecause thou must take care of it hereafter.  See, then, my Jo--ah, the\\ndear, funny little name--I had a wish to tell something the day I said\\ngoodbye in New York, but I thought the handsome friend was betrothed to\\nthee, and so I spoke not.  Wouldst thou have said \\'Yes\\', then, if I had\\nspoken?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know.  I\\'m afraid not, for I didn\\'t have any heart just then.\"\\n\\n\"Prut!  That I do not believe.  It was asleep till the fairy prince\\ncame through the wood, and waked it up.  Ah, well, \\'Die erste Liebe ist\\ndie beste\\', but that I should not expect.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, the first love is the best, but be so contented, for I never had\\nanother.  Teddy was only a boy, and soon got over his little fancy,\"\\nsaid Jo, anxious to correct the Professor\\'s mistake.\\n\\n\"Good!  Then I shall rest happy, and be sure that thou givest me all.\\nI haf waited so long, I am grown selfish, as thou wilt find,\\nProfessorin.\"\\n\\n\"I like that,\" cried Jo, delighted with her new name.  \"Now tell me\\nwhat brought you, at last, just when I wanted you?\"\\n\\n\"This,\" and Mr. Bhaer took a little worn paper out of his waistcoat\\npocket.\\n\\nJo unfolded it, and looked much abashed, for it was one of her own\\ncontributions to a paper that paid for poetry, which accounted for her\\nsending it an occasional attempt.\\n\\n\"How could that bring you?\" she asked, wondering what he meant.\\n\\n\"I found it by chance.  I knew it by the names and the initials, and in\\nit there was one little verse that seemed to call me.  Read and find\\nhim.  I will see that you go not in the wet.\"\\n\\n\\n    IN THE GARRET\\n\\n    Four little chests all in a row,\\n    Dim with dust, and worn by time,\\n    All fashioned and filled, long ago,\\n    By children now in their prime.\\n    Four little keys hung side by side,\\n    With faded ribbons, brave and gay\\n    When fastened there, with childish pride,\\n    Long ago, on a rainy day.\\n    Four little names, one on each lid,\\n    Carved out by a boyish hand,\\n    And underneath there lieth hid\\n    Histories of the happy band\\n    Once playing here, and pausing oft\\n    To hear the sweet refrain,\\n    That came and went on the roof aloft,\\n    In the falling summer rain.\\n\\n    \"Meg\" on the first lid, smooth and fair.\\n    I look in with loving eyes,\\n    For folded here, with well-known care,\\n    A goodly gathering lies,\\n    The record of a peaceful life--\\n    Gifts to gentle child and girl,\\n    A bridal gown, lines to a wife,\\n    A tiny shoe, a baby curl.\\n    No toys in this first chest remain,\\n    For all are carried away,\\n    In their old age, to join again\\n    In another small Meg\\'s play.\\n    Ah, happy mother!

I never thought it\\nwould go where it could tell tales,\" said Jo, tearing up the verses the\\nProfessor had treasured so long.\\n\\n\"Let it go, it has done its duty, and I will haf a fresh one when I\\nread all the brown book in which she keeps her little secrets,\" said\\nMr. Bhaer with a smile as he watched the fragments fly away on the\\nwind.  \"Yes,\" he added earnestly, \"I read that, and I think to myself,\\nShe has a sorrow, she is lonely, she would find comfort in true love.\\nI haf a heart full, full for her.  Shall I not go and say, \\'If this is\\nnot too poor a thing to gif for what I shall hope to receive, take it\\nin Gott\\'s name?\\'\"\\n\\n\"And so you came to find that it was not too poor, but the one precious\\nthing I needed,\" whispered Jo.\\n\\n\"I had no courage to think that at first, heavenly kind as was your\\nwelcome to me.  But soon I began to hope, and then I said, \\'I will haf\\nher if I die for it,\\' and so I will!\" cried Mr. Bhaer, with a defiant\\nnod, as if the walls of mist closing round them were barriers which he\\nwas to surmount or valiantly knock down.\\n\\nJo thought that was splendid, and resolved to be worthy of her knight,\\nthough he did not come prancing on a charger in gorgeous array.\\n\\n\"What made you stay away so long?\" she asked presently, finding it so\\npleasant to ask confidential questions and get delightful answers that\\nshe could not keep silent.\\n\\n\"It was not easy, but I could not find the heart to take you from that\\nso happy home until I could haf a prospect of one to gif you, after\\nmuch time, perhaps, and hard work.  How could I ask you to gif up so\\nmuch for a poor old fellow, who has no fortune but a little learning?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad you are poor.  I couldn\\'t bear a rich husband,\" said Jo\\ndecidedly, adding in a softer tone, \"Don\\'t fear poverty. I\\'ve known it\\nlong enough to lose my dread and be happy working for those I love, and\\ndon\\'t call yourself old--forty is the prime of life.  I couldn\\'t help\\nloving you if you were seventy!\"\\n\\nThe Professor found that so touching that he would have been glad of\\nhis handkerchief, if he could have got at it.  As he couldn\\'t, Jo wiped\\nhis eyes for him, and said, laughing, as she took away a bundle or\\ntwo...\\n\\n\"I may be strong-minded, but no one can say I\\'m out of my sphere now,\\nfor woman\\'s special mission is supposed to be drying tears and bearing\\nburdens.  I\\'m to carry my share, Friedrich, and help to earn the home.\\nMake up your mind to that, or I\\'ll never go,\" she added resolutely, as\\nhe tried to reclaim his load.\\n\\n\"We shall see.  Haf you patience to wait a long time, Jo? I must go\\naway and do my work alone.  I must help my boys first, because, even\\nfor you, I may not break my word to Minna.  Can you forgif that, and be\\nhappy while we hope and wait?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I know I can, for we love one another, and that makes all the\\nrest easy to bear.  I have my duty, also, and my work. I couldn\\'t enjoy\\nmyself if I neglected them even for you, so there\\'s no need of hurry or\\nimpatience.  You can do your part out West, I can do mine here, and\\nboth be happy hoping for the best, and leaving the future to be as God\\nwills.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! Thou gifest me such hope and courage, and I haf nothing to gif\\nback but a full heart and these empty hands,\" cried the Professor,\\nquite overcome.\\n\\nJo never, never would learn to be proper, for when he said that as they\\nstood upon the steps, she just put both hands into his, whispering\\ntenderly, \"Not empty now,\" and stooping down, kissed her Friedrich\\nunder the umbrella.  It was dreadful, but she would have done it if the\\nflock of draggle-tailed sparrows on the hedge had been human beings,\\nfor she was very far gone indeed, and quite regardless of everything\\nbut her own happiness. Though it came in such a very simple guise, that\\nwas the crowning moment of both their lives, when, turning from the\\nnight and storm and loneliness to the household light and warmth and\\npeace waiting to receive them, with a glad \"Welcome home!\"  Jo led her\\nlover in, and shut the door.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'FORTY-SEVEN\\n\\nHARVEST TIME\\n\\nFor a year Jo and her Professor worked and waited, hoped and loved, met\\noccasionally, and wrote such voluminous letters that the rise in the\\nprice of paper was accounted for, Laurie said.  The second year began\\nrather soberly, for their prospects did not brighten, and Aunt March\\ndied suddenly.  But when their first sorrow was over--for they loved\\nthe old lady in spite of her sharp tongue--they found they had cause\\nfor rejoicing, for she had left Plumfield to Jo, which made all sorts\\nof joyful things possible.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a fine old place, and will bring a handsome sum, for of course\\nyou intend to sell it,\" said Laurie, as they were all talking the\\nmatter over some weeks later.\\n\\n\"No, I don\\'t,\" was Jo\\'s decided answer, as she petted the fat poodle,\\nwhom she had adopted, out of respect to his former mistress.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t mean to live there?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I do.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear girl, it\\'s an immense house, and will take a power of\\nmoney to keep it in order.  The garden and orchard alone need two or\\nthree men, and farming isn\\'t in Bhaer\\'s line, I take it.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'ll try his hand at it there, if I propose it.\"\\n\\n\"And you expect to live on the produce of the place?  Well, that sounds\\nparadisiacal, but you\\'ll find it desperate hard work.\"\\n\\n\"The crop we are going to raise is a profitable one,\" and Jo laughed.\\n\\n\"Of what is this fine crop to consist, ma\\'am?\"\\n\\n\"Boys.  I want to open a school for little lads--a good, happy,\\nhomelike school, with me to take care of them and Fritz to teach them.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s a truly Joian plan for you!  Isn\\'t that just like her?\" cried\\nLaurie, appealing to the family, who looked as much surprised as he.\\n\\n\"I like it,\" said Mrs. March decidedly.\\n\\n\"So do I,\" added her husband, who welcomed the thought of a chance for\\ntrying the Socratic method of education on modern youth.\\n\\n\"It will be an immense care for Jo,\" said Meg, stroking the head of her\\none all-absorbing son.\\n\\n\"Jo can do it, and be happy in it.  It\\'s a splendid idea. Tell us all\\nabout it,\" cried Mr. Laurence, who had been longing to lend the lovers\\na hand, but knew that they would refuse his help.\\n\\n\"I knew you\\'d stand by me, sir.  Amy does too--I see it in her eyes,\\nthough she prudently waits to turn it over in her mind before she\\nspeaks.  Now, my dear people,\" continued Jo earnestly, \"just understand\\nthat this isn\\'t a new idea of mine, but a long cherished plan.  Before\\nmy Fritz came, I used to think how, when I\\'d made my fortune, and no\\none needed me at home, I\\'d hire a big house, and pick up some poor,\\nforlorn little lads who hadn\\'t any mothers, and take care of them, and\\nmake life jolly for them before it was too late.  I see so many going\\nto ruin for want of help at the right minute, I love so to do anything\\nfor them, I seem to feel their wants, and sympathize with their\\ntroubles, and oh, I should so like to be a mother to them!\"\\n\\nMrs. March held out her hand to Jo, who took it, smiling, with tears in\\nher eyes, and went on in the old enthusiastic way, which they had not\\nseen for a long while.\\n\\n\"I told my plan to Fritz once, and he said it was just what he would\\nlike, and agreed to try it when we got rich.  Bless his dear heart,\\nhe\\'s been doing it all his life--helping poor boys, I mean, not getting\\nrich, that he\\'ll never be.  Money doesn\\'t stay in his pocket long\\nenough to lay up any.  But now, thanks to my good old aunt, who loved\\nme better than I ever deserved, I\\'m rich, at least I feel so, and we\\ncan live at Plumfield perfectly well, if we have a flourishing school.\\nIt\\'s just the place for boys, the house is big, and the furniture\\nstrong and plain.  There\\'s plenty of room for dozens inside, and\\nsplendid grounds outside. They could help in the garden and orchard.\\nSuch work is healthy, isn\\'t it, sir?  Then Fritz could train and teach\\nin his own way, and Father will help him.  I can feed and nurse and pet\\nand scold them, and Mother will be my stand-by.  I\\'ve always longed for\\nlots of boys, and never had enough, now I can fill the house full and\\nrevel in the little dears to my heart\\'s content.  Think what luxury--\\nPlumfield my own, and a wilderness of boys to enjoy it with me.\"\\n\\nAs Jo waved her hands and gave a sigh of rapture, the family went off\\ninto a gale of merriment, and Mr. Laurence laughed till they thought\\nhe\\'d have an apoplectic fit.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t see anything funny,\" she said gravely, when she could be\\nheard.  \"Nothing could be more natural and proper than for my Professor\\nto open a school, and for me to prefer to reside in my own estate.\"\\n\\n\"She is putting on airs already,\" said Laurie, who regarded the idea in\\nthe light of a capital joke.  \"But may I inquire how you intend to\\nsupport the establishment? If all the pupils are little ragamuffins,\\nI\\'m afraid your crop won\\'t be profitable in a worldly sense, Mrs.\\nBhaer.\"\\n\\n\"Now don\\'t be a wet-blanket, Teddy.  Of course I shall have rich\\npupils, also--perhaps begin with such altogether.  Then, when I\\'ve got\\na start, I can take in a ragamuffin or two, just for a relish. Rich\\npeople\\'s children often need care and comfort, as well as poor. I\\'ve\\nseen unfortunate little creatures left to servants, or backward ones\\npushed forward, when it\\'s real cruelty.  Some are naughty through\\nmismanagment or neglect, and some lose their mothers. Besides, the best\\nhave to get through the hobbledehoy age, and that\\'s the very time they\\nneed most patience and kindness.  People laugh at them, and hustle them\\nabout, try to keep them out of sight, and expect them to turn all at\\nonce from pretty children into fine young men.  They don\\'t complain\\nmuch--plucky little souls--but they feel it.  I\\'ve been through\\nsomething of it, and I know all about it. I\\'ve a special interest in\\nsuch young bears, and like to show them that I see the warm, honest,\\nwell-meaning boys\\' hearts, in spite of the clumsy arms and legs and the\\ntopsy-turvy heads.  I\\'ve had experience, too, for haven\\'t I brought up\\none boy to be a pride and honor to his family?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll testify that you tried to do it,\" said Laurie with a grateful\\nlook.\\n\\n\"And I\\'ve succeeded beyond my hopes, for here you are, a steady,\\nsensible businessman, doing heaps of good with your money, and laying\\nup the blessings of the poor, instead of dollars. But you are not\\nmerely a businessman, you love good and beautiful things, enjoy them\\nyourself, and let others go halves, as you always did in the old times.\\nI am proud of you, Teddy, for you get better every year, and everyone\\nfeels it, though you won\\'t let them say so.  Yes, and when I have my\\nflock, I\\'ll just point to you, and say \\'There\\'s your model, my lads\\'.\"\\n\\nPoor Laurie didn\\'t know where to look, for, man though he was,\\nsomething of the old bashfulness came over him as this burst of praise\\nmade all faces turn approvingly upon him.\\n\\n\"I say, Jo, that\\'s rather too much,\" he began, just in his old boyish\\nway.  \"You have all done more for me than I can ever thank you for,\\nexcept by doing my best not to disappoint you.  You have rather cast me\\noff lately, Jo, but I\\'ve had the best of help, nevertheless.  So, if\\nI\\'ve got on at all, you may thank these two for it,\" and he laid one\\nhand gently on his grandfather\\'s head, and the other on Amy\\'s golden\\none, for the three were never far apart.\\n\\n\"I do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the\\nworld!\" burst out Jo, who was in an unusually up-lifted frame of mind\\njust then.  \"When I have one of my own, I hope it will be as happy as\\nthe three I know and love the best.  If John and my Fritz were only\\nhere, it would be quite a little heaven on earth,\" she added more\\nquietly.  And that night when she went to her room after a blissful\\nevening of family counsels, hopes, and plans, her heart was so full of\\nhappiness that she could only calm it by kneeling beside the empty bed\\nalways near her own, and thinking tender thoughts of Beth.\\n\\nIt was a very astonishing year altogether, for things seemed to happen\\nin an unusually rapid and delightful manner.  Almost before she knew\\nwhere she was, Jo found herself married and settled at Plumfield.  Then\\na family of six or seven boys sprung up like mushrooms, and flourished\\nsurprisingly, poor boys as well as rich, for Mr. Laurence was\\ncontinually finding some touching case of destitution, and begging the\\nBhaers to take pity on the child, and he would gladly pay a trifle for\\nits support.  In this way, the sly old gentleman got round proud Jo,\\nand furnished her with the style of boy in which she most delighted.\\n\\nOf course it was uphill work at first, and Jo made queer mistakes, but\\nthe wise Professor steered her safely into calmer waters, and the most\\nrampant ragamuffin was conquered in the end. How Jo did enjoy her\\n\\'wilderness of boys\\', and how poor, dear Aunt March would have lamented\\nhad she been there to see the sacred precincts of prim, well-ordered\\nPlumfield overrun with Toms, Dicks, and Harrys!  There was a sort of\\npoetic justice about it, after all, for the old lady had been the\\nterror of the boys for miles around, and now the exiles feasted freely\\non forbidden plums, kicked up the gravel with profane boots unreproved,\\nand played cricket in the big field where the irritable \\'cow with a\\ncrumpled horn\\' used to invite rash youths to come and be tossed.  It\\nbecame a sort of boys\\' paradise, and Laurie suggested that it should be\\ncalled the \\'Bhaer-garten\\', as a compliment to its master and\\nappropriate to its inhabitants.\\n\\nIt never was a fashionable school, and the Professor did not lay up a\\nfortune, but it was just what Jo intended it to be--\\'a happy, homelike\\nplace for boys, who needed teaching, care, and kindness\\'.  Every room\\nin the big house was soon full.  Every little plot in the garden soon\\nhad its owner.  A regular menagerie appeared in barn and shed, for pet\\nanimals were allowed. And three times a day, Jo smiled at her Fritz\\nfrom the head of a long table lined on either side with rows of happy\\nyoung faces, which all turned to her with affectionate eyes, confiding\\nwords, and grateful hearts, full of love for \\'Mother Bhaer\\'.  She had\\nboys enough now, and did not tire of them, though they were not angels,\\nby any means, and some of them caused both Professor and Professorin\\nmuch trouble and anxiety.  But her faith in the good spot which exists\\nin the heart of the naughtiest, sauciest, most tantalizing little\\nragamuffin gave her patience, skill, and in time success, for no mortal\\nboy could hold out long with Father Bhaer shining on him as\\nbenevolently as the sun, and Mother Bhaer forgiving him seventy times\\nseven.  Very precious to Jo was the friendship of the lads, their\\npenitent sniffs and whispers after wrongdoing, their droll or touching\\nlittle confidences, their pleasant enthusiasms, hopes, and plans, even\\ntheir misfortunes, for they only endeared them to her all the more.\\nThere were slow boys and bashful boys, feeble boys and riotous boys,\\nboys that lisped and boys that stuttered, one or two lame ones, and a\\nmerry little quadroon, who could not be taken in elsewhere, but who was\\nwelcome to the \\'Bhaer-garten\\', though some people predicted that his\\nadmission would ruin the school.\\n\\nYes, Jo was a very happy woman there, in spite of hard work, much\\nanxiety, and a perpetual racket.  She enjoyed it heartily and found the\\napplause of her boys more satisfying than any praise of the world, for\\nnow she told no stories except to her flock of enthusiastic believers\\nand admirers.  As the years went on, two little lads of her own came to\\nincrease her happiness--Rob, named for Grandpa, and Teddy, a\\nhappy-go-lucky baby, who seemed to have inherited his papa\\'s sunshiny\\ntemper as well as his mother\\'s lively spirit.  How they ever grew up\\nalive in that whirlpool of boys was a mystery to their grandma and\\naunts, but they flourished like dandelions in spring, and their rough\\nnurses loved and served them well.\\n\\nThere were a great many holidays at Plumfield, and one of the most\\ndelightful was the yearly apple-picking.  For then the Marches,\\nLaurences, Brookes and Bhaers turned out in full force and made a day\\nof it.  Five years after Jo\\'s wedding, one of these fruitful festivals\\noccurred, a mellow October day, when the air was full of an\\nexhilarating freshness which made the spirits rise and the blood dance\\nhealthily in the veins.  The old orchard wore its holiday attire.\\nGoldenrod and asters fringed the mossy walls. Grasshoppers skipped\\nbriskly in the sere grass, and crickets chirped like fairy pipers at a\\nfeast.  Squirrels were busy with their small harvesting.  Birds\\ntwittered their adieux from the alders in the lane, and every tree\\nstood ready to send down its shower of red or yellow apples at the\\nfirst shake.  Everybody was there. Everybody laughed and sang, climbed\\nup and tumbled down.  Everybody declared that there never had been such\\na perfect day or such a jolly set to enjoy it, and everyone gave\\nthemselves up to the simple pleasures of the hour as freely as if there\\nwere no such things as care or sorrow in the world.\\n\\nMr. March strolled placidly about, quoting Tusser, Cowley, and\\nColumella to Mr. Laurence, while enjoying...\\n\\nThe gentle apple\\'s winey juice.\\n\\nThe Professor charged up and down the green aisles like a stout\\nTeutonic knight, with a pole for a lance, leading on the boys, who made\\na hook and ladder company of themselves, and performed wonders in the\\nway of ground and lofty tumbling.  Laurie devoted himself to the little\\nones, rode his small daughter in a bushel-basket, took Daisy up among\\nthe bird\\'s nests, and kept adventurous Rob from breaking his neck.\\nMrs. March and Meg sat among the apple piles like a pair of Pomonas,\\nsorting the contributions that kept pouring in, while Amy with a\\nbeautiful motherly expression in her face sketched the various groups,\\nand watched over one pale lad, who sat adoring her with his little\\ncrutch beside him.\\n\\nJo was in her element that day, and rushed about, with her gown pinned\\nup, and her hat anywhere but on her head, and her baby tucked under her\\narm, ready for any lively adventure which might turn up.  Little Teddy\\nbore a charmed life, for nothing ever happened to him, and Jo never\\nfelt any anxiety when he was whisked up into a tree by one lad,\\ngalloped off on the back of another, or supplied with sour russets by\\nhis indulgent papa, who labored under the Germanic delusion that babies\\ncould digest anything, from pickled cabbage to buttons, nails, and\\ntheir own small shoes.  She knew that little Ted would turn up again in\\ntime, safe and rosy, dirty and serene, and she always received him back\\nwith a hearty welcome, for Jo loved her babies tenderly.\\n\\nAt four o\\'clock a lull took place, and baskets remained empty, while\\nthe apple pickers rested and compared rents and bruises.  Then Jo and\\nMeg, with a detachment of the bigger boys, set forth the supper on the\\ngrass, for an out-of-door tea was always the crowning joy of the day.\\nThe land literally flowed with milk and honey on such occasions, for\\nthe lads were not required to sit at table, but allowed to partake of\\nrefreshment as they liked--freedom being the sauce best beloved by the\\nboyish soul.  They availed themselves of the rare privilege to the\\nfullest extent, for some tried the pleasing experiment of drinking milk\\nwhile standing on their heads, others lent a charm to leapfrog by\\neating pie in the pauses of the game, cookies were sown broadcast over\\nthe field, and apple turnovers roosted in the trees like a new style of\\nbird.  The little girls had a private tea party, and Ted roved among\\nthe edibles at his own sweet will.\\n\\nWhen no one could eat any more, the Professor proposed the first\\nregular toast, which was always drunk at such times--\"Aunt March, God\\nbless her!\"  A toast heartily given by the good man, who never forgot\\nhow much he owed her, and quietly drunk by the boys, who had been\\ntaught to keep her memory green.\\n\\n\"Now, Grandma\\'s sixtieth birthday!  Long life to her, with three times\\nthree!\"\\n\\nThat was given with a will, as you may well believe, and the cheering\\nonce begun, it was hard to stop it.  Everybody\\'s health was proposed,\\nfrom Mr. Laurence, who was considered their special patron, to the\\nastonished guinea pig, who had strayed from its proper sphere in search\\nof its young master.  Demi, as the oldest grandchild, then presented\\nthe queen of the day with various gifts, so numerous that they were\\ntransported to the festive scene in a wheelbarrow.  Funny presents,\\nsome of them, but what would have been defects to other eyes were\\nornaments to Grandma\\'s--for the children\\'s gifts were all their own.\\nEvery stitch Daisy\\'s patient little fingers had put into the\\nhandkerchiefs she hemmed was better than embroidery to Mrs. March.\\nDemi\\'s miracle of mechanical skill, though the cover wouldn\\'t shut,\\nRob\\'s footstool had a wiggle in its uneven legs that she declared was\\nsoothing, and no page of the costly book Amy\\'s child gave her was so\\nfair as that on which appeared in tipsy capitals, the words--\"To dear\\nGrandma, from her little Beth.\"\\n\\nDuring the ceremony the boys had mysteriously disappeared, and when\\nMrs. March had tried to thank her children, and broken down, while\\nTeddy wiped her eyes on his pinafore, the Professor suddenly began to\\nsing.  Then, from above him, voice after voice took up the words, and\\nfrom tree to tree echoed the music of the unseen choir, as the boys\\nsang with all their hearts the little song that Jo had written, Laurie\\nset to music, and the Professor trained his lads to give with the best\\neffect.  This was something altogether new, and it proved a grand\\nsuccess, for Mrs. March couldn\\'t get over her surprise, and insisted on\\nshaking hands with every one of the featherless birds, from tall Franz\\nand Emil to the little quadroon, who had the sweetest voice of all.\\n\\nAfter this, the boys dispersed for a final lark, leaving Mrs. March and\\nher daughters under the festival tree.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think I ever ought to call myself \\'unlucky Jo\\' again, when my\\ngreatest wish has been so beautifully gratified,\" said Mrs. Bhaer,\\ntaking Teddy\\'s little fist out of the milk pitcher, in which he was\\nrapturously churning.\\n\\n\"And yet your life is very different from the one you pictured so long\\nago.  Do you remember our castles in the air?\" asked Amy, smiling as\\nshe watched Laurie and John playing cricket with the boys.\\n\\n\"Dear fellows!  It does my heart good to see them forget business and\\nfrolic for a day,\" answered Jo, who now spoke in a maternal way of all\\nmankind.  \"Yes, I remember, but the life I wanted then seems selfish,\\nlonely, and cold to me now.  I haven\\'t given up the hope that I may\\nwrite a good book yet, but I can wait, and I\\'m sure it will be all the\\nbetter for such experiences and illustrations as these,\" and Jo pointed\\nfrom the lively lads in the distance to her father, leaning on the\\nProfessor\\'s arm, as they walked to and fro in the sunshine, deep in one\\nof the conversations which both enjoyed so much, and then to her\\nmother, sitting enthroned among her daughters, with their children in\\nher lap and at her feet, as if all found help and happiness in the face\\nwhich never could grow old to them.\\n\\n\"My castle was the most nearly realized of all.  I asked for splendid\\nthings, to be sure, but in my heart I knew I should be satisfied, if I\\nhad a little home, and John, and some dear children like these.  I\\'ve\\ngot them all, thank God, and am the happiest woman in the world,\" and\\nMeg laid her hand on her tall boy\\'s head, with a face full of tender\\nand devout content.\\n\\n\"My castle is very different from what I planned, but I would not alter\\nit, though, like Jo, I don\\'t relinquish all my artistic hopes, or\\nconfine myself to helping others fulfill their dreams of beauty.  I\\'ve\\nbegun to model a figure of baby, and Laurie says it is the best thing\\nI\\'ve ever done.  I think so, myself, and mean to do it in marble, so\\nthat, whatever happens, I may at least keep the image of my little\\nangel.\"\\n\\nAs Amy spoke, a great tear dropped on the golden hair of the sleeping\\nchild in her arms, for her one well-beloved daughter was a frail little\\ncreature and the dread of losing her was the shadow over Amy\\'s\\nsunshine.  This cross was doing much for both father and mother, for\\none love and sorrow bound them closely together. Amy\\'s nature was\\ngrowing sweeter, deeper, and more tender.  Laurie was growing more\\nserious, strong, and firm, and both were learning that beauty, youth,\\ngood fortune, even love itself, cannot keep care and pain, loss and\\nsorrow, from the most blessed for ...\\n\\n\\n    Into each life some rain must fall,\\n    Some days must be dark and sad and dreary.\\n\\n\\n\"She is growing better, I am sure of it, my dear.  Don\\'t despond, but\\nhope and keep happy,\" said Mrs. March, as tenderhearted Daisy stooped\\nfrom her knee to lay her rosy cheek against her little cousin\\'s pale\\none.\\n\\n\"I never ought to, while I have you to cheer me up, Marmee, and Laurie\\nto take more than half of every burden,\" replied Amy warmly.  \"He never\\nlets me see his anxiety, but is so sweet and patient with me, so\\ndevoted to Beth, and such a stay and comfort to me always that I can\\'t\\nlove him enough.  So, in spite of my one cross, I can say with Meg,\\n\\'Thank God, I\\'m a happy woman.\\'\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s no need for me to say it, for everyone can see that I\\'m far\\nhappier than I deserve,\" added Jo, glancing from her good husband to\\nher chubby children, tumbling on the grass beside her.  \"Fritz is\\ngetting gray and stout.  I\\'m growing as thin as a shadow, and am\\nthirty.  We never shall be rich, and Plumfield may burn up any night,\\nfor that incorrigible Tommy Bangs will smoke sweet-fern cigars under\\nthe bed-clothes, though he\\'s set himself afire three times already.\\nBut in spite of these unromantic facts, I have nothing to complain of,\\nand never was so jolly in my life.  Excuse the remark, but living among\\nboys, I can\\'t help using their expressions now and then.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Jo, I think your harvest will be a good one,\" began Mrs. March,\\nfrightening away a big black cricket that was staring Teddy out of\\ncountenance.\\n\\n\"Not half so good as yours, Mother.  Here it is, and we never can thank\\nyou enough for the patient sowing and reaping you have done,\" cried Jo,\\nwith the loving impetuosity which she never would outgrow.\\n\\n\"I hope there will be more wheat and fewer tares every year,\" said Amy\\nsoftly.\\n\\n\"A large sheaf, but I know there\\'s room in your heart for it, Marmee\\ndear,\" added Meg\\'s tender voice.\\n\\nTouched to the heart, Mrs. March could only stretch out her arms, as if\\nto gather children and grandchildren to herself, and say, with face and\\nvoice full of motherly love, gratitude, and humility...\\n\\n\"Oh, my girls, however long you may live, I never can wish you a\\ngreater happiness than this!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Little Women, by Louisa May Alcott\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LITTLE WOMEN ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 514-8.txt or 514-8.zip *****\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/514/\\n\\n\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\nwill be renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\npeople in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\n\\n\\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\n\\n\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n\\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n']"
